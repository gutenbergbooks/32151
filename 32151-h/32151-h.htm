<h3>TO EUGÈNIE H.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">We</span> have shared together many hours of
study, and you have been willing, at the cost
of much patient labor, to cheer the difficult
paths of intellectual toil by the unfailing sweetness
of your beloved companionship. It seems
to me that all those things which we have
learned together are doubly my own; whilst
those other studies which I have pursued in
solitude have never yielded me more than
a maimed and imperfect satisfaction. The
dream of my life would be to associate you
with all I do if that were possible; but since
the ideal can never be wholly realized, let me
at least rejoice that we have been so little separated,
and that the subtle influence of your
finer taste and more delicate perception is
ever, like some penetrating perfume, in the
whole atmosphere around me.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">I propose</span>, in the following pages, to consider
the possibilities of a satisfactory intellectual
life under various conditions of ordinary
human existence. It will form a part
of my plan to take into account favorable and
unfavorable influences of many kinds; and
my chief purpose, so far as any effect upon
others may be hoped for, will be to guard
some who may read the book alike against
the loss of time caused by unnecessary discouragement,
and the waste of effort which is
the consequence of misdirected energies.</p>

<p>I have adopted the form of letters addressed
to persons of very different position in order
that every reader may have a chance of finding
what concerns him. The letters, it is unnecessary
to observe, are in one sense as fictitious
as those we find in novels, for they
have never been sent to anybody by the post,
yet the persons to whom they are addressed
are not imaginary. I made it a rule, from
the beginning, to think of a real person when
writing, from an apprehension that by dwelling
in a world too exclusively ideal I might
lose sight of many impediments which beset
all actual lives, even the most exceptional and
fortunate.</p>

<p>The essence of the book may be expressed
in a few sentences, the rest being little more
than evidence or illustration. First, it appears
that all who are born with considerable
intellectual faculties are urged towards the
intellectual life by irresistible instincts, as
water-fowl are urged to an aquatic life; but
the lower animals have this advantage over
man, that as their purposes are simpler, so
they attain them more completely than he
does. The life of a wild duck is in perfect accordance
with its instincts, but the life of an
intellectual man is never on all points perfectly
in accordance with <i>his</i> instincts. Many
of the best intellectual lives known to us have
been hampered by vexatious impediments of
the most various and complicated kinds; and
when we come to have accurate and intimate
knowledge of the lives led by our intellectual
contemporaries, we are always quite sure to
find that each of them has some great thwarting
difficulty to contend against. Nor is it
too much to say that if a man were so placed
and endowed in every way that all his work
should be made as easy as the ignorant imagine
it to be, that man would find in that very
facility itself a condition most unfavorable to
his intellectual growth. So that, however
circumstances may help us or hinder us, the
intellectual life is always a contest or a discipline,
and the art or skill of living intellectually
does not so much consist in surrounding
ourselves with what is reputed to be advantageous
as in compelling every circumstance
and condition of our lives to yield us some
tribute of intellectual benefit and force. The
needs of the intellect are as various as intellects
themselves are various: and if a man
has got high mental culture during his passage
through life it is of little consequence
where he acquired it, or how. The school of
the intellectual man is the place where he
happens to be, and his teachers are the people,
books, animals, plants, stones, and earth
round about him. The feeling almost always
predominant in the minds of intellectual men
as they grow older, is not so much one of regret
that their opportunities were not more
abundant, as of regret that they so often
missed opportunities which they might have
turned to better account.</p>

<p>I have written for all classes, in the conviction
that the intellectual life is really within
the reach of every one who earnestly desires
it. The highest culture can never be within
the reach of those who cannot give the years
of labor which it costs; and if we cultivate
ourselves to shine in the eyes of others, to become
famous in literature or science, then of
course we must give many more hours of labor
than can be spared from a life of practical
industry. But I am fully convinced of this,
convinced by the observation of living instances
in all classes, that any man or woman
of large natural capacity may reach the tone
of thinking which may justly be called intellectual,
even though that thinking may not
be expressed in the most perfect language.
The essence of intellectual living does not reside
in extent of science or in perfection of
expression, but in a constant preference for
higher thoughts over lower thoughts, and this
preference may be the habit of a mind which
has not any very considerable amount of information.
This may be very easily demonstrated
by a reference to men who lived intellectually
in ages when science had scarcely
begun to exist, and when there was but little
literature that could be of use as an aid to
culture. The humblest subscriber to a mechanics&rsquo;
institute has easier access to sound
learning than had either Solomon or Aristotle,
yet both Solomon and Aristotle lived the intellectual
life. Whoever reads English is
richer in the aids to culture than Plato was,
yet Plato <i>thought</i> intellectually. It is not
erudition that makes the intellectual man,
but a sort of virtue which delights in vigorous
and beautiful thinking, just as moral virtue
delights in vigorous and beautiful conduct.
Intellectual living is not so much an
accomplishment as a state or condition of
the mind in which it seeks earnestly for the
highest and purest truth. It is the continual
exercise of a firmly noble choice between the
larger truth and the lesser, between that
which is perfectly just and that which falls
a little short of justice. The ideal life would
be to choose thus firmly and delicately always,
yet if we often blunder and fail for
want of perfect wisdom and clear light, have
we not the inward assurance that our aspiration
has not been all in vain, that it has
brought us a little nearer to the Supreme Intellect
whose effulgence draws us whilst it
dazzles? Here is the true secret of that fascination
which belongs to intellectual pursuits,
that they reveal to us a little more, and yet a
little more, of the eternal order of the Universe,
establishing us so firmly in what is
known, that we acquire an unshakable confidence
in the laws which govern what is not,
and never can be, known.</p>

<h3 class="pt3">LETTER I.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG MAN OF LETTERS WHO WORKED
EXCESSIVELY.</h5>

<p class="pro">Mental labor believed to be innocuous to healthy persons&mdash;Difficulty
of testing this&mdash;Case of the poet Wordsworth&mdash;Case
of an eminent living author&mdash;Case of a literary clergyman&mdash;Case
of an energetic tradesman&mdash;Instances of two
Londoners who wrote professionally&mdash;Scott&rsquo;s paralysis&mdash;Byron&rsquo;s
death&mdash;All intellectual labor proceeds on a physical
basis.</p>

<p><span class="sc">So</span> little is really known about the action of
the nervous system, that to go into the subject
from the physiological point of view
would be to undertake a most difficult investigation,
entirely beyond the competence
of an unscientific person like your present
correspondent. You will, therefore, permit
me, in reference to this, to leave you to the
teaching of the most advanced physiologists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
of the time; but I may be able to offer a few
practical suggestions, based on the experience
of intellectual workers, which may be of use
to a man whose career is likely to be one of
severe and almost uninterrupted intellectual
labor.</p>

<p>A paper was read several years ago before
the members of a society in London, in which
the author maintained that mental labor was
never injurious to a perfectly healthy human
organization, and that the numerous cases of
break-down, which are commonly attributed
to excessive brain-work, are due, in reality, to
the previous operation of disease.</p>

<p>This is one of those assertions which cannot
be answered in a sentence. Concentrated
within the briefest expression it comes to this,
that mental labor cannot produce disease, but
may aggravate the consequences of disease
which already exists.</p>

<p>The difficulty of testing this is obvious; for
so long as health remains quite perfect, it remains
perfect, of course, whether the brain is
used or not; and when failure of health becomes
manifest, it is not always easy to decide
in what degree mental labor may have been
the cause of it. Again, the accuracy of so
general a statement cannot be proved by any
number of instances in its favor, since it is
universally admitted that brain-work is not
the only cause of disease, and no one affirms
that it is more than one amongst many causes
which may impede the bodily functions.</p>

<p>When the poet Wordsworth was engaged in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
composing the &ldquo;White Doe of Rylstone,&rdquo; he
received a wound in his foot, and he observed
that the continuation of the literary labor
increased the irritation of the wound; whereas
by suspending his work he could diminish
it, and absolute mental rest produced a perfect
cure. In connection with this incident he
remarked that poetic excitement, accompanied
by protracted labor in composition, always
brought on more or less of bodily derangement.
He preserved himself from permanently
injurious consequences by his excellent
habits of life.</p>

<p>A very eminent living author, whose name
I do not feel at liberty to mention, is always
prostrated by severe illness at the conclusion
of each of his works; another is unwell every
Sunday, because he does not write on that
day, and the recoil after the mental stretch of
the week is too much for him.</p>

<p>In the case of Wordsworth, the physical
constitution is believed to have been sound.
His health at seventy-two was excellent; the
two other instances are more doubtful in this
respect, yet both these writers enjoy very fair
health, after the pressure of brain-work has
been removed for any considerable time. A
clergyman of robust organization, who does
a good deal of literary work at intervals, told
me that, whenever he had attempted to make
it regular, the consequence had always been
distressing nervous sensations, from which at
other times he was perfectly free. A tradesman,
whose business affords an excellent outlet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
for energetic bodily activity, told me that
having attempted, in addition to his ordinary
work, to acquire a foreign language which
seemed likely to be useful to him, he had been
obliged to abandon it on account of alarming
cerebral symptoms. This man has immense
vigor and energy, but the digestive functions,
in this instance, are sluggish. However,
when he abandoned study, the cerebral inconveniences
disappeared, and have never returned
since.</p>

<p>Two Londoners who followed literature as a
profession, and who both worked to excess,
had cerebral attacks of a still more decided
kind. One of them, after his recovery, resolved
to regulate his work in future, so that
it might never pass the limits of moderation.
He is now living, and in possession of a remarkably
clear and richly furnished intellect.
The other, who returned to his old habits,
died in two years from softening of the
brain. I am not aware that in these cases
there was any other disease than that produced
by an immoderate use of the mental
powers.</p>

<p>The health of Sir Walter Scott&mdash;we have
this on his own testimony&mdash;was uncommonly
robust, and there is every reason to believe
that his paralysis was brought on by the excessive
labor which resulted from his pecuniary
embarrassments, and that without such
excessive mental labor and anxiety he would
have preserved his health much longer. The
death of Byron was due, no doubt, quite as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
much to habits of dissipation as to poetical excitement;
still it is probable that he would
have borne either of these evil influences if it
had not been accompanied by the other; and
that to a man whose way of life was so exhausting
as Byron&rsquo;s was, the addition of constant
poetical excitement and hard work in
production, may be said without exaggeration
to have killed him. We know that Scott,
with all his facility, had a dread of that kind
of excitement, and withdrew from the poetical
arena to avoid it. We know, too, that
the brain of Southey proved ultimately unable
to endure the burden of the tasks he laid
upon it.</p>

<p>Difficult as it may be in some instances to
ascertain quite accurately whether an overworked
man had perfectly sound bodily health
to begin with, obvious as it may be that in
many breakdowns the final failure has been
accelerated by diseases independent of mental
work, the facts remain, that the excessive exercise
of the mental powers is injurious to
bodily health and that all intellectual labor
proceeds upon a physical basis. No man can
safely forget this, and act as if he were a pure
spirit, superior to physical considerations.
Let me then, in other letters on this subject,
direct your attention to the close connection
which exists between intellectual production
and the state of the body and the brain; not
with the authority of a physician, but with
the sympathy of a fellow-laborer, who has
learned something from his own experience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
and still more from the more varied experience
of his friends.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG MAN OF LETTERS WHO WORKED
EXCESSIVELY.</h5>

<p class="pro">Mental labor rarely compatible with the best physical conditions&mdash;Wordsworth&rsquo;s
manner of composition&mdash;Mr. W. F.
A. Delane&mdash;George Sand working under pressure&mdash;Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s field-sports&mdash;Physical exercise the best
tranquillizer of the nervous system&mdash;Eugène Sue&mdash;Shelley&rsquo;s
love of boating&mdash;Nervousness the affliction of brain-workers&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s
kindly warning&mdash;Working by spurts&mdash;Beckford&mdash;Byron&mdash;Indolence
of men of genius fortunate&mdash;Distressing
nature of cerebral fatigue.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is possible that many of the worst results
of intellectual labor may be nothing more
than indirect results. We may suffer, not
from the work itself, but from sedentary
confinement, from want of exercise, from
insufficient variety and amusement.</p>

<p>Mental labor is seldom compatible with
the best physical conditions; it is so sometimes,
however, or may be made so by an
effort of will and resolution. Wordsworth
composed his poetry in the open air, as he
walked, and so preserved himself from the
evil of close confinement to the desk. Mr.
W. F. A. Delane, who did so much for the
organization of the <i>Times</i> newspaper when it
was under his management, began by doing
law reports for that paper, in London and on
circuit. His appearance of rude health surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
other members of his profession, but
he accounted for it by the care he took to
compensate for the bad air and sedentary labor
in the courts of law by travelling between
the assize towns on horseback, and also by a
more than commonly temperate way of life,
since he carefully avoided the bar dinners,
eating and drinking for health alone. It is
possible to endure the most unhealthy labor
when there are frequent intervals of invigorating
exercise, accompanied by habits of
strict sobriety. The plan, so commonly resorted
to, of trying to get health in stock for
the rest of the year by a fortnight&rsquo;s hurried
travelling in the autumn, is not so good as
Mr. Delane&rsquo;s way of getting the week&rsquo;s supply
of health during the course of the week
itself.</p>

<p>It happened once that George Sand was
hurried by the proprietor of a newspaper who
wanted one of her novels as a <i>feuilleton</i>.
She has always been a careful and deliberate
worker, very anxious to give all necessary
labor in preparation, and, like all such conscientious
laborers, she can scarcely endure
to be pushed. However, on this occasion she
worked overtime, as they say in Lancashire,
and to enable herself to bear the extra pressure
she did part of the work at night in order
to keep several hours of daylight clear
for her walks in the country, where she lived.
Many writers, in the same situation, would
have temporarily abandoned exercise, but
George Sand clung to it all the more at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
time when it was especially necessary that
she should be well. In the same way Sir
Walter Scott counterbalanced the effects of
sedentary occupation by his hearty enjoyment
of field-sports. It has been supposed
that his outdoor exercise, which to weaker
persons appears excessive, may have helped
to bring on the stroke of paralysis which finally
disabled him; but the fact is, that when the
stroke arrived Sir Walter had altered his
habits of life in obedience to what he believed
to be his duty, and had abandoned, or nearly
so, the active amusements of his happier
years. I believe rather that whilst he took so
much exercise his robust constitution not
only enabled him to endure it without injury,
but required it to keep the nervous system
healthy, in spite of his hard work in literary
composition. Physical exercise, when the
constitution is strong enough to endure it, is
by far the best tranquillizer of the nervous
system which has yet been discovered, and
Sir Walter&rsquo;s life at Abbotsford was, in this
respect at least, grounded on the true philosophy
of conduct. The French romancer, Eugene
Sue, wrote till ten o&rsquo;clock every morning,
and passed the rest of the day, when at
his country house, either in horse-exercise, or
field-sports, or gardening, for all of which he
had a liking which amounted to passion.
Shelley&rsquo;s delight was boating, which at once
exercised his muscles and relieved his mind
from the weariness of incessant invention or
speculation. It will generally be found, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
whenever a man of much intellectual distinction
has maintained his powers in full activity,
it has been by avoiding the bad effects of
an entirely sedentary life.</p>

<p>I well believe that a person naturally robust,
with a clear and powerful brain, could
bear twelve or fourteen hours&rsquo; work every
day for years together so far as the work itself
is concerned, if only so large an expenditure
of time left a sufficient margin for amusement,
and exercise, and sleep. But the privation
of exercise, by weakening the digestive
and assimilative powers, reduces the flow of
healthy and rich blood to the brain&mdash;the brain
requires an enormous quantity of blood, especially
when the cerebral matter is rapidly
destroyed by intellectual labor&mdash;and usually
brings on nervousness, the peculiar affliction
of the over-driven mental laborer. This nervousness
is Nature&rsquo;s kindly warning, preserving
us, if we attend to it in time, from much
more serious consequences. The best preventive
of it, and often the only cure, is plenty of
moderate exercise. The customs of the upper
classes in England happily provide this
in the best shape, that of amusement enjoyed
in society, but our middle classes in large
towns do not get nearly enough of it, and the
most studious are always strongly tempted to
neglect it altogether.</p>

<p>Men of great imaginative power are commonly
addicted to a habit which is peculiarly
dangerous. They work as race-horses work,
with the utmost intensity of effort during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
short spaces of time, taxing all their powers
whilst the brilliant effort lasts. When Beckford
wrote the wonderful tale &ldquo;Vathek&rdquo; in
his twentieth year, he did it at a single sitting,
which lasted for three days and two
nights, and it cost him a serious illness. Several
of the best poems by Byron were written,
if not quite with equal rapidity, still on the
same principle of composition at white heat.
In cases of this kind, Nature provides her
own remedy in the indolence of the imaginative
temperament, which leaves large spaces
of time for the action of the recuperative processes.
The same law governs the physical
energies of the carnivora, which maintain, or
recover, their capacity for extraordinary effort
by intervals of absolute repose. In its
long spaces of mental rest the imaginative
temperament recruits itself by amusement,
which in England usually includes physical
exercise of some kind.</p>

<p>This fortunate indolence of men of genius
would in most instances ensure their safety if
they were not impelled by necessity to labor
beyond the suggestions of inclination. The
exhausted brain never of itself seeks the additional
exhaustion of hard work. You know
very well when you are tired, and at such
times the natural man in you asks plainly
enough for rest and recreation. The art is so
to arrange our lives that the natural man may
sometimes have his way, and forget, if only
for a time, the labors which lead to weariness&mdash;not
to that pleasant weariness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
body which promises soundest sleep, but the
distressing fatigue of the exhausted spirit
which is tortured by the importunity of ideas
which it is unable to express, and apprehensions
that it cannot dismiss, which fights
through the sleepless night the phantoms of
unconquerable horror.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;The bad effect of literary composition on the physical
state which was observed by Wordsworth in his own case
was also noticed by Shelley during the composition of the
&ldquo;Cenci,&rdquo; which, he said, had been a fine antidote to nervous
medicines, and kept, he believed, the pain in his side &ldquo;as sticks
do a fire.&rdquo; These influences are best observed in people whose
health is delicate. Although Joubert, for example, had an
extremely clear intellect, he could scarcely write at all on account
of the physical consequences. I have come to the conclusion
that literary work <i>acts simply as a strong stimulant</i>.
In moderate quantities it is not only innocent, but decidedly
beneficial; in excess it acts like poison on the nervous system.
What constitutes excess every man has to find out by his own
experience. A page was excess to Joubert, a chapter was
moderation to Alexandre Dumas.</p></div>

<h5>TO A STUDENT IN UNCERTAIN HEALTH.</h5>

<p class="pro">Habits of Kant, the philosopher&mdash;Objection to an over-minute

coffee&mdash;Case of an English clergyman&mdash;Balzac&mdash;The Arabia
custom of coffee-drinking&mdash;Wisdom of occasionally
using stimulants.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Immanuel Kant</span>, who was a master in the
art of taking care of himself, had by practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
acquired a dexterous mode of folding himself
up in the bed-clothes, by passing them over
and under his shoulders, so that, when the
operation was complete, he was shut up like
the silkworm in his cocoon. &ldquo;When I am
thus snugly folded up in my bed,&rdquo; he would
say to his friends, &ldquo;I say to myself, can any
man be in better health than I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is nothing in the lives of philosophers
more satisfactory than this little passage. If
Kant had said to himself, &ldquo;Can anybody be
wiser, more learned, more justly deserving of
immortal fame than I am?&rdquo; we should have
felt, that however agreeable this opinion might
have been to the philosopher who held it, his
private satisfaction stood in need of confirmation
from without; and even if he had really
been all this, we might have reflected that
wisdom and learning still leave their possessor
exposed to the acutest kinds of suffering.
But when a philosopher rolls himself up
at night, and congratulates himself on the
possession of perfect health, we only think
what a happy man he was to possess that first
of blessings, and what a sensible man to know
the value of it! And Kant had a deeper happiness
in this reflection than any which could
spring from the mere consciousness of possessing
one of the unearned gifts of nature. The
excellence of his health was due in part to a
sufficiently good constitution, but it was due
also to his own extreme carefulness about his
habits. By an unceasing observation of his
own bodily life, as far as possible removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
from the anxiety of hypochondriacs, he managed
to keep the physical machine in such
regular order, that for more than thirty years
he always rose precisely at the same minute.
If his object had been health for health&rsquo;s
sake, the result would still have been well
worth any sacrifices of momentary inclination
that it cost him; but Kant had a higher purpose.
He well knew that the regularity of
the intellectual life depended entirely on the
regularity of the bodily functions, and, unlike
the foolish men alluded to by Goethe who
pass the day in complaining of headache,
and the night in drinking the wine that produces
it, Kant not only knew that regular
health was necessary to his work as a philosopher,
but did everything in his power to
preserve it. Few intellectual laborers have
in this respect given evidence of such persistent
strength of will.</p>

<p>In his manner of living he did not consult
custom, but the needs of his individual nature.
It is not always easy for great brain-workers
to follow with perfect fidelity the
customs of the people about them. These
usages have been gradually formed by the
majority to suit the needs of the majority;
but there are cases where a close adherence
to them would be a serious hindrance
to the highest and best activity. A good
example of this is Kant&rsquo;s intense antipathy
to beer. It did not suit him, and he was
right in his non-conformity to German usage
on this point, but he was mistaken in believing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
beer to be universally injurious. There
is a very general belief in England that what
is called a good breakfast is the foundation of
the labor of the day. Kant&rsquo;s breakfast, which
he took at five in the morning at all seasons
of the year, consisted of a cup of tea and a
pipe of tobacco. On this he worked eight
hours, either in lecturing or writing&mdash;a long
stretch of uninterrupted labor. He dined at
one, and this was his only meal, for he had
no supper. The single repast was a deviation
from ordinary usage, but Kant found that it
suited him, probably because he read in the
evening from six till a quarter to ten, and a
second meal might have interfered with this
by diminishing his power of attention. There
exists a strong medical objection to this habit
of taking only one meal in twenty-four
hours, which indeed is almost unknown in
England, though not extremely rare on the
Continent. I know an old gentleman who
for forty years has lived as Kant did, and
enjoys excellent health and uncommon
mental clearness.</p>

<p>A detail which illustrates Kant&rsquo;s attention
to whatever could affect his physical life, is
his rule to withdraw his mind from everything
requiring effort fifteen minutes before
he went to bed. His theory, which is fully
confirmed by the experience of others, was,
that there was a risk of missing sleep if the
brain was not tranquillized before bed-time.
He knew that the intellectual life of the day
depended on the night&rsquo;s rest, and he took this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
precaution to secure it. The regularity of
his daily walk, taken during the afternoon in
all weathers, and the strict limitation of the
hours of rest, also helped the soundness of his sleep.</p>

<p>He would not walk out in company, for the
whimsical reason that if he opened his mouth
a colder air would reach his lungs than that
which passed through the nostrils; and he
would not eat alone, but always had guests to
dinner. There are good physiological reasons
in favor of pleasant society at table, and, besides
these, there are good intellectual reasons
also.</p>

<p>By attention to these rules of his, Kant managed
to keep both body and mind in a working
order, more uninterrupted than is usual
with men who go through much intellectual
labor. The solitary objection to his system is
the excessive regularity of habit to which it
bound him by chains of his own forging. He
found a quiet happiness in this regularity;
indeed, happiness is said to be more commonly
found in habit that in anything else, so deeply
does it satisfy a great permanent instinct of
our nature. But a <i>minute</i> regularity of habit
is objectionable, because it can only be practicable
at home, and is compatible only with
an existence of the most absolute tranquillity.
Kant did not travel, and never could have
travelled. He was a bachelor, and could not
have ceased to be a bachelor, without a
disturbance that would have been intolerable
to him. He enjoyed the full benefits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
his system without experiencing its disadvantages,
but any considerable change of situation
would have made the disadvantages
apparent. Few lives can be so minutely regulated
without risk of future inconvenience.</p>

<p>Kant&rsquo;s example is a good one so far as this,
that it proved a sort of independence of character
which would be valuable to every student.
All who need to keep their minds in the
best possible condition ought to have resolution
enough to regulate their living in a manner
which experience, in their case, proves to
be most favorable. Whatever may be the
authority of custom, a wise man makes
himself independent of usages which are
impediments to his best activity. I know an
author who was always unwell about eleven
o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;so unwell that he
could do nothing but lament his miserable
fate. Knowing by experience the powerful
effect of regimen, I inquired whether he enjoyed
his breakfast. &ldquo;No, he did not.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then why did he attempt to eat any breakfast?&rdquo;
It turned out that this foolish man
swallowed every morning two cups of bad
coffee and a quantity of greasy food, from a
patriotic deference to the customs of his country.
He was persuaded to abandon this unsuitable
habit and to eat nothing till half-past
ten, when his adviser prescribed a well-cooked
little <i>déjeuner à la fourchette</i>, accompanied by
half a bottle of sound Bordeaux. The effect
was magical. My friend felt light and cheerful
before <i>déjeuner</i>, and worked quite happily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
and well, whilst after <i>déjeuner</i> he felt like a
horse that has eaten his corn. Nor was the
good effect a transitory one; the bad symptoms
never returned and he still adheres to
his new arrangement. This little reform made
a wretched existence happy, and has had for
its result an increase in production with a
diminution of fatigue. The explanation is that
the stomach did not ask for the early breakfast,
and had a hard fight to overcome it,
after which came exhaustion and a distaste
both for food and work. There are cases where
an opposite rule is the right one. An Englishman
living in Paris found the French <i>déjeuner</i>
unsuitable for him, and discovered that
he worked best on a substantial English breakfast,
with strong tea, at eight in the morning,
after which he went on working all day without
any further nourishment till dinner at six
in the evening. A friend of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s,
who had stayed with him at Abbotsford, told
me that Sir Walter ate and drank like everybody
else as to times and seasons, but much
more abundantly than people of less vigorous
organization. Goethe used to work till eleven
without taking anything, then he drank a cup
of chocolate and worked till one. &ldquo;At two
he dined. This meal was the important meal
of the day. His appetite was immense. Even
on the days when he complained of not being
hungry he ate much more than most men.
Puddings, sweets, and cakes were always welcome.
He sat a long while over his wine.
He was fond of wine, and drank daily his two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
or three bottles.&rdquo; An eminent French publisher,
one of the most clear-headed and
hard-working men of his generation, never
touched food or drink till six in the evening,
when he ate an excellent dinner with his
guests. He found this system favorable to
his work, but a man of less robust constitution
would have felt exhausted in the course of the
day.</p>

<p>Turgot could not work well till after he had
dined copiously, but many men cannot think
after a substantial meal; and here, in spite of
the example set by Scott and Goethe, let me
observe that nothing interferes so much with
brainwork as over-eating. The intellectual
workman requires nourishment of the best
possible quality, but the quantity ought
always to be well within the capacity of his
digestive powers. The truth appears to be,
that whilst the intellectual life makes very
large demands upon nutrition&mdash;for cerebral
activity cannot go forward without constant
supplies of force, which must come ultimately
from what we have eaten&mdash;this kind of life,
being sedentary, is unfavorable to the work
of digestion. Brain-workers cannot eat like
sportsmen and farmers without losing many
hours in torpor, and yet they need nutrition
as much as if they led active lives. The only
way out of this difficulty is to take care that
the food is good enough for a moderate quantity
of it to maintain the physical and mental
powers. The importance of scientific cookery
can hardly be exaggerated. Intellectual labor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
is, in its origin, as dependent upon the
art of cookery as the dissemination of its results
is dependent upon paper-making and
printing. This is one of those matters which
people cannot be brought to consider seriously;
but cookery in its perfection&mdash;the great science
of preparing food in the way best suited
to our use&mdash;is really the most important of all
sciences, and the mother of the arts. The
wonderful theory that the most ignorant
cookery is the most favorable to health is
only fit for the dark ages. It is grossly and
stupidly untrue. A scientific cook will
keep you in regular health, when an ignorant
one will offer you the daily alternative of
starving or indigestion.</p>

<p>The great question of drinks is scarcely less
important. Sound natural wines, not strengthened
by any addition of alcohol, are known
to supply both stimulus and nourishment to
the brain. Goethe&rsquo;s practice was not irrational,
though he drank fifty thousand bottles
in his lifetime. Still it is not necessary to
imitate him to this extent. The wine-drinking
populations have keener and livelier wits
than those who use other beverages. It is
proved by long experience that the pure juice
of the grape sustains the force and activity of
the brain. The poets who from age to age
have sung the praise of wine were not wholly
either deceivers or deceived. In the lands of
the vine, where the plant is looked upon as a
nursing mother, men do not injure their health
by drinking; but in the colder North, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
the grape can never ripen, the deaths from
intemperance are frequent. Bread and wine
are almost pure gifts of nature, though both
are prepared by man after the old traditional
ways. These are not poisons, but gin and
absinthe are poisons, madness poured out
from a bottle! Kant and Goethe loved the
pure Rhine wine, and their brains were clear
and vigorous to the utmost span of life. It
was not wine that ruined Burns and Byron,
or Baudelaire, or Alfred de Musset.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Kant&rsquo;s horror of beer, that
honest northern drink deserves our friendly
recognition. It has quite a peculiar effect
upon the nervous system, giving a rest and
calm which no other drink can procure for it
so safely. It is said that beer drinkers are
slow, and a little stupid; that they have an
ox-like placidity not quite favorable to any
brilliant intellectual display. But there are
times when this placidity is what the laboring
brain most needs. After the agitations of too
active thinking there is safety in a tankard of
ale. The wine drinkers are agile, but they
are excitable; the beer drinkers are heavy,
but in their heaviness there is peace. In that
clear golden drink which England has brewed
for more than a thousand Octobers, and will
brew for a thousand more, we may find perhaps
some explanation of that absence of irritability
which is the safe-guard of the national
character, which makes it faithful in
its affections, easy to govern, not easy to excite
to violence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span> </p>

<p>If I have spoken favorably of beer and wine
as having certain intellectual uses, please remember
that I recommend only the habitual
use of them, not mad rites of Bacchus, and
even the habitual use only just so far as it
may suit the individual constitution. The
liberal regimen of Scott and Goethe would
not answer in every case, and there are organizations,
often very robust, in which intoxicating
drinks of all kinds, even in the
most moderate quantity, impede the brain&rsquo;s
action instead of aiding it. Two of the most
able men I have ever known could not drink
pure wine of any kind because it sent the
blood to the head, with consequent cerebral
oppression. And whilst on this subject I
ought to observe, that the aid which these
stimulants afford, even when the body gratefully
accepts them, is often treacherous from
its very acceptability. Men who are over-driven&mdash;and
the number of such men is unhappily
very great in these days&mdash;say that
without stimulants they could not get through
their labor; but the stimulants often delude
us as to the limits of our natural powers and
encourage us to attempt too much. The help
they give us is not altogether illusory; under
certain limitations it is real, but many have
gone farther than the reality of the assistance
warranted. The ally brings to us an increase
of forces, but he comes with appearances of
power surpassing the reality, and we undertake
tasks beyond our strength. In drinking,
as in eating, the best rule for the intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
is moderation in quantity with good quality,
a sound wine, and not enough of it to foster
self-delusion.</p>

<p>The use of tobacco has so much extended itself
in the present generation that we are all
obliged to make a decision for ourselves on
the ancient controversy between its friends
and enemies. We cannot form a reasonable
opinion about tobacco without bearing in
mind that it produces, according to circumstances,
one of two entirely distinct and even
opposite classes of effects. In certain states
of the body it acts as a stimulant, in other
states as a narcotic. People who have a dislike
to smoking affirm that it stupefies; but
this assertion, at least so far as the temporary
consequences are concerned, is not supported
by experience. Most of the really brilliant
conversations that I have listened to have
been accompanied by clouds of tobacco-smoke;
and a great deal of the best literary
composition that is produced by contemporary
authors is wrought by men who are actually
smoking whilst they work. My own experience
is that very moderate smoking acts as
a pleasant stimulus upon the brain, whilst it
produces a temporary lassitude of the muscular
system, not perceptible in times of rest,
but an appreciable hindrance in times of muscular
exertion. It is better therefore for men
who feel these effects from tobacco to avoid it
when they are in exercise, and to use it only
when the body rests and the mind labors.
Pray remember, however, that this is the experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
of an exceedingly moderate smoker,
who has not yet got himself into the general
condition of body which is brought on by a
larger indulgence in tobacco. On the other
hand, it is evident that men engaged in physical
labor find a muscular stimulus in occasional
smoking, and not a temporary lassitude.
It is probable that the effect varies with individual
cases, and is never precisely what
our own experience would lead us to imagine.
For excessive smokers, it appears to be little
more than the tranquillizing of a sort of uneasiness,
the continual satisfaction of a continual
craving. I have never been able to ascertain
that moderate smoking diminished intellectual
force; but I have observed in excessive
smokers a decided weakening of the will,
and a preference for talking about work to
the effort of actual labor. The opinions of
medical men on this subject are so much at
variance that their science only adds to our
uncertainty. One doctor tells me that the
most moderate smoking is unquestionably injurious,
whilst others affirm that it is innocent.
Speaking simply from self-observation,
I find that in my own case tea and coffee are
far more perilous than tobacco.</p>

<p>Almost all English people are habitual tea-drinkers,
and as the tea they drink is very
strong, they may be said to use it in excess.
The unpleasant symptoms which tea-poisoning
produces in a patient not inured by habit,
disappear in the seasoned tea-drinker, leaving
only a certain exhilaration, which appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
be perfectly innocuous. If tea is a safe stimulant,
it is certainly an agreeable one, and
there seems to be no valid reason why brain-workers
should refuse themselves that solace.
I knew a worthy clergyman many years ago
who from the most conscientious motives denied
himself ale and wine, but found a fountain
of consolation in the tea-pot. His usual
allowance was sixteen cups, all of heroic
strength, and the effect upon his brain seems
to have been altogether favorable, for his sermons
were both long and eloquent, and to
this day he is preaching still, without any
diminution of his powers. French people
find in coffee the most efficacious remedy for
the temporary torpor of the mind which results
from the processes of digestion. Balzac
drank great quantities of coffee whilst he
wrote; and this, it is believed, brought on
the terrible nervous disease that accelerated
his end. The best proof that tea and coffee
are favorable to intellectual expression is that
all nations use one or the other as aids to
conversation. In Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s Travels in
Arabia there is never any talk without the
inevitable coffee, that fragrant Arabian berry
prepared with such delicate cunning that it
yields the perfect aroma.</p>

<p>The wisdom of occasionally using these various
stimulants for intellectual purposes is
proved by a single consideration. Each of
us has a little cleverness and a great deal of
sluggish stupidity. There are certain occasions
when we absolutely need the little cleverness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
that we possess. The orator needs it
when he speaks, the poet when he versifies,
but neither cares how stupid he may become
when the oration is delivered and the lyric
set down on paper. The stimulant serves to
bring out the talent when it is wanted, like
the wind in the pipes of an organ. &ldquo;What
will it matter if I am even a little duller afterwards?&rdquo;
says the genius; &ldquo;I can afford to be
dull when I have done.&rdquo; But the truth still
remains that there are stimulants and stimulants.
Not the nectar of the gods themselves
were worth the dash of a wave upon the
beach, and the pure cool air of the morning.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;What is said in the above letter about the employment
of stimulants is intended to apply only to cases in which
there is no organic disease. The harm which diseased persons
do to themselves by conforming to customs which are
innocent for others is as lamentable as it is easily avoidable.
Two bottles of any natural wine grown above the latitude of
Lyons are a permissible daily allowance to a man whose organs
are all sound; but the doctors in the wine districts unanimously
forbid pure wine when there is a chronic inflammatory
tendency. In these cases even the most honest Bordeaux
ought to be diluted with twice its volume of water. There
are many chronic diseases which tobacco irritates and accelerates.
Both wine and tobacco are injurious to weak eyes.</p></div>

<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>TO A MUSCULAR CHRISTIAN.</h5>

<p class="pro">Muscular and intellectual tendencies in two boys&mdash;Difficulty
of finding time to satisfy both&mdash;Plato on the influences of
music and gymnastics&mdash;Somnolence and digestion&mdash;Neglect
of literature&mdash;Natural restlessness of the active temperament&mdash;Case
of a Garibaldian officer&mdash;Difficulty of
taking a sufficient interest in exercise&mdash;A boar hunt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I know</span> two little boys, sons of a near neighbor,
who have from, childhood exhibited opposite
tendencies. One of them is incessantly
active, always out of doors in any weather,
busy about horses, and farming, and game,
heedless of his books, and studying only under
positive compulsion. The other sits at
home with his lessons or a story book, and
only goes out because he is incited by the fraternal
example. The two lads represent two
distinct varieties of human life, the active
and the intellectual. The elder is happiest
during physical exertion; the younger is
happiest when his brain is fully occupied.
Left entirely to themselves, without the
equalizing influence of the outside world and
the ways of living which general custom has
established, they would lead the most opposite
lives. The elder would inevitably become a
farmer, that he might live in the country and
take exercise all day long, or else he would
seek adventure in wild travel, or in romantic
warfare; but the younger would very quickly
be taken possession of by some engrossing
intellectual pursuit, and lead the life of a sedentary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
student. The problem which these
two young lives have before them is the reconciliation
of their tendencies. Since they
come of cultivated parents, the intellectual
lad has the better chance of following his own
bent. Both will have to take their University
degrees, and the younger has the advantage
there. Still there are powerful influences
in favor of the elder. His activity will be
encouraged by the admiration of his companions,
and by the example of the country gentlemen
who are his neighbors. He can ride,
and row, and swim; he is beginning to shoot;
at twenty he will be a sportsman. When
once he has taken his degree, I wonder what
will be the advances in his intellectual culture.
Fraternal and social influences will preserve
the younger from absolute physical inaction;
but there are not any influences powerful
enough to keep the elder safe from intellectual
rust.</p>

<p>If you, who are a distinguished sportsman
and athlete, would kindly inform us with
perfect frankness of the line which your studies
have followed since you quitted Eton, we
should be the wiser for your experience.
Have gymnastic exercises hardened you, as
Plato said they did, when pursued excessively?
and do you need the musical studies
which he both valued and dreaded as the most
powerful of softening influences? If you have
energy enough to lead both lives, pray how
do you find the time?</p>

<p>As to Plato&rsquo;s musical influence, you invite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
it, and yet you treacherously elude its power.
After being out all day in the pursuit
of sylvan pleasures (if shooting on treeless
wastes can be called a sylvan pleasure), you
come home at nightfall ravenous. Then you
do ample justice to your dinner, and having
satisfied your <i>faim de chasseur</i>, you go into
the drawing-room, and ask your wife to play
and sing to you. If Plato could witness that
pretty scene, he would approve your obedience
to his counsels. He would behold an
athletic Englishman stretching his mighty
limbs on a couch of soft repose, and letting
his soul grow tender as his ears drank ravishing
harmonies. If, however, the ancient
sage, delighted with so sweet a picture of
strength refined by song, were to dwell upon
the sight as I have done, he would perceive
too soon that, although your body was present
indeed, your soul had become deaf in
sleep&rsquo;s oblivion. So it happens to you night
after night, and the music reaches you no
more than the songs of choristers reach the
dead in the graves below.</p>

<p>And the elevating influences of literature?
You have books, of course, in abundance.
There is a library, amongst other luxuries of
your home. But the literature your intellect
feeds upon is in the columns of the <i>Field</i>,
your newspaper. Yet this neglect of the
means of culture is not due to any natural
feebleness of the mind. Your brain, by its nature,
is as vigorous as your vigorous body.
It is sleep, and weariness, and the great necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
business of digestion, that drown your
intellectual energies. The work of repairing
so great a destruction of muscle is nature&rsquo;s
chief concern. Since you became the mighty
hunter that you are, the wear and tear have
been enormous, and the necessary rapidity of
reconstruction has absorbed your rich vitality.</p>

<p>I will not question the wisdom of your
choice, if there has been any deliberate
choice, though perhaps the life of action that
you lead may have grown rather out of circumstances
determining habit than from any
conscious resolution. Health is so much
more necessary to happiness than culture,
that few who could choose between them
would sacrifice it for learning, unless they
were impelled by irresistible instincts. And
beyond the great delight of health and
strength there is a restlessness in men born to
be active which must have its outlet in activity.
I knew a brave Italian who had followed
Garibaldi in all his romantic enterprises,
who had suffered from privation and
from wounds, who had not only faced death
in the wildest adventures, but, what is even
more terrible to the active temperament, had
risked health from frequent exposure; and
when I asked him whether it was affection to
his famous chief, or faith in a political creed,
or some more personal motive that had led
him to this scorn of prudence, he answered
that, after honest self-examination, he believed
the most powerful motive to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
passion for an active life. The active temperament
likes physical action for its own
sake, and not as a means of health. Activity
renews itself and claims larger and larger
satisfaction, till at last the habit of it absorbs
the whole energy of the man.</p>

<p>Although such a life as yours would be incompatible
with the work I have to do, it
would be an unmixed benefit to me to take a
greater interest in exercise. If you could
but communicate that interest, how willingly
would I become your pupil! The fatal law of
the studious temperament is, that in exercise
itself it must find some intellectual charm, so
that we quit our books in the library only to
go and read the infinite book of nature. We
cannot go out in the country without incessantly
thinking about either botany, or geology,
or landscape painting, and it is difficult
for us to find a refuge from the importunate
habit of investigation. Sport is the only refuge,
but the difficulty is to care about it sufficiently
to avoid <i>ennui</i>. When you have not
the natural instinct, how are you to supply
its place by any make-believe excitement?
There is no position in the world more wearisome
than that of a man inwardly indifferent
to the amusement in which he is trying to
take part. <i>You</i> can watch for game with an
invincible patience, for you have the natural
instinct, but after the first ten minutes on the
skirts of the wood I lay my gun down and begin
to botanize. Last week a friendly neighbor
invited me to a boar-hunt. The boar was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
supposed to be in the middle of a great impenetrable
plantation, and all I did during
the whole morning was to sit in my saddle
awaiting the exit of the beast, cantering from
one point of the wood&rsquo;s circumference to another,
as the cry of the dogs guided me. Was
it pleasure? A true hunter would have found
interest enough in expectation, but I felt like
a man on a railway-platform who is waiting
for a train that is late.</p>

<p>How applicable, my dear brother, are these

They have quite a personal applicability

us of our disobedience, and tell us in
language not to be misinterpreted, to amend
the error of our ways? Our digestion is
sluggish and imperfect; we are as nervous as
delicate ladies, and there is no health in
us.</p>

<p>How easy it is to follow one of the two
lives&mdash;the animal or the intellectual! how
difficult to conciliate the two! In every one
of us there exists an animal which might
have been as vigorous as wolves and foxes, if
it had been left to develop itself in freedom.
But besides the animal, there existed also a
mind, and the mental activity restrained the
bodily activity, till at last there is a serious
danger of putting an end to it altogether.</p>

<p>I know two men, about fifty-five years old
both of them, and both of them admirably active.
They tell me that their bodily activity
has been preserved by an effort of the will;
that if they had not resolutely kept up the
habit of using legs and arms in daily work or
amusement their limbs would have stiffened
into uselessness, and their constitutions would
have been unable to bear the call of any sudden
emergency. One of them has four residences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
in different parts of the same county,
and yet he will not keep a carriage, but is a
pedestrian terrible to his friends; the other is
at the head of a great business, and gives an
example of physical activity to his workpeople.
Both have an absolute faith in habitual
exercise; and both affirm that if the habit
were once broken they could never afterwards
resume it.</p>

<p>We need this faith in exercise&mdash;this firm
conviction of its necessity&mdash;the sort of conviction
that makes a man go out in all weathers,
and leave the most urgent intellectual
labor for the mere discipline and hardening
of the body. Few students possess this faith
in its purity. It is hard to believe that we
shall get any good from exercise proportionate
to the sacrifice of time.</p>

<p>The incompatibility between the physical
and the intellectual lives is often very marked
if you look at small spaces of time only; but
if you consider broader spaces, such as a
lifetime, then the incompatibility is not so
marked, and gives place to a manifest conciliation.
The brain is clearer in vigorous health
than it can be in the gloom and misery of
sickness; and although health may last for a
while without renewal from exercise, so that
if you are working under pressure for a
month the time given to exercise is so much
deducted from the result, it is not so for the
life&rsquo;s performance. Health sustained for
many years is so useful to the realization of
all considerable intellectual undertakings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
that the sacrifice to the bodily well-being is
the best of all possible investments.</p>

<p>Franklin&rsquo;s theory about concentrating his
exercise for the economy of time was founded
upon a mistake. Violent exertion for minutes
is <i>not</i> equivalent to moderate exercise for
hours. The desire to concentrate good of various
kinds into the smallest possible space is
one of the commonest of <i>human</i> wishes, but
it is not encouraged by the broader economy
of nature. In the exercise of the mind every
teacher is well aware that time is an essential
factor. It is necessary to <i>live</i> with a study
for hundreds or thousands of hours before
the mind can assimilate as much of the subject
as it may need; and so it is necessary to
live in exercise during a thousand hours of
every year to make sure of the physical benefits.
Even the fresh air itself requires time
to renovate our blood. The fresh air cannot
be concentrated; and to breathe the prodigious
quantities of it which are needed for perfect
energy, we must be out in it frequently
and long.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of great cities have recourse
to gymnastics as a substitute for the sports of
the country. These exercises have one advantage&mdash;they
can be directed scientifically
so as to strengthen the limbs that need development;
but no city gymnasium can offer the
invigorating breezes of the mountain. We
require not only exercise but exposure&mdash;daily
exposure to the health-giving inclemencies of
the weather. The postman who brings my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
letters walks eight thousand miles a year, and
enjoys the most perfect regularity of health.
There are operatives in factories who go
through quite as much bodily exertion, but
they have not his fine condition. He is as
merry as a lark, and announces himself every
morning like a bearer of joyful tidings.
What the postman does from necessity an old
gentleman did as regularly, though more moderately,
for the preservation of his health and
faculties. He went out every day; and as he
never consulted the weather, so he never had
to consult the physicians.</p>

<p>Nothing in the habits of Wordsworth&mdash;that
model of excellent habits&mdash;can be better as an
example to men of letters than his love of
pedestrian excursions. Wherever he happened
to be, he explored the whole neighborhood
on foot, looking into every nook and
cranny of it; and not merely the immediate
neighborhood, but extended tracts of country;
and in this way he met with much of his best
material. Scott was both a pedestrian and an
equestrian traveller, having often, as he tells
us, walked thirty miles or ridden a hundred
in those rich and beautiful districts which afterwards
proved to him such a mine of literary
wealth. Goethe took a wild delight in all
sorts of physical exercise&mdash;swimming in the
Ilm by moonlight, skating with the merry
little Weimar court on the Schwansee, riding
about the country on horseback, and becoming
at times quite outrageous in the rich exuberance
of his energy. Alexander Humboldt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
was delicate in his youth, but the longing for
great enterprises made him dread the hindrances
of physical insufficiency, so he accustomed
his body to exercise and fatigue, and
prepared himself for those wonderful explorations
which opened his great career. Here
are intellectual lives which were forwarded in
their special aims by habits of physical exercise;
and, in an earlier age, have we not also
the example of the greatest intellect of a great
epoch, the astonishing Leonardo da Vinci,
who took such a delight in horsemanship that
although, as Vasari tells us, poverty visited
him often, he never could sell his horses or
dismiss his grooms?</p>

<p>The physical and intellectual lives are not
incompatible. I may go farther, and affirm
that the physical activity of men eminent in
literature has added abundance to their material
and energy to their style; that the activity
of scientific men has led them to innumerable
discoveries; and that even the more
sensitive and contemplative study of the fine
arts has been carried to a higher perfection by
artists who painted action in which they had
had their part, or natural beauty, which they
had travelled far to see. Even philosophy
itself owes much to mere physical courage
and endurance. How much that is noblest
in ancient thinking may be due to the hardy
health of Socrates!</p>

<h5>TO AN AUTHOR IN MORTAL DISEASE.</h5>

<p class="pro">Considering death as a certainty&mdash;The wisdom learned from
suffering&mdash;Employment of happier intervals&mdash;The teaching
of the diseased not to be rejected&mdash;Their double experience&mdash;Ignorance
of Nature&rsquo;s spoiled children&mdash;Benefit
of disinterested thought&mdash;Reasons for pursuing intellectual
labors to the last&mdash;Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.</p>

<p><span class="sc">When</span> Alexandre Bixio lay on his death-bed,
his friend Labrousse visited him, and exclaimed
on entering the room, &ldquo;How well
you are looking to-day!&rdquo; To this, Bixio, who
was clearly aware of his condition, answered
in these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Voyons, mon pauvre Labrousse;
tu viens voir un homme qui n&rsquo;a plus
qu&rsquo;un quart d&rsquo;heure a vivre, et tu veux lui
faire croire qu&rsquo;il a bonne mine; allons, une
poignée de main, cela vaut mieux pour un
homme que tous ces petits mensonges-lá.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will vex you with none of these well-meant
but wearisome little falsehoods. We
both of us know your state; we both know
that your malady, though it may be alleviated,
can never be cured; and that the fatal
termination of it, though delayed by all the
artifices of science, will certainly arrive at
last. The cheerful courage which enables you
to look this certainty in the face has also enabled
you to extract from years of suffering
that profoundest wisdom which (as one of the
wisest of living Englishmen has told us) can
be learned from suffering alone. The admirable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
elasticity of your intellectual and moral
nature has enabled you, in the intervals of
physical uneasiness or pain, to cast aside
every morbid thought, to enter quite fully and
heartily into the healthy life of others, and to
enjoy the magnificent spectacle of the universe
with contented submission to its laws&mdash;those
beneficent yet relentless laws which to
you bring debility and death. You have continued
to write notwithstanding the progress
of your malady; and yet, since it has so pitilessly
held you, there is no other change in
the spirit of your compositions than the deepening
of a graver beauty, the addition of a
sweeter seriousness. Not one sentence that
you have written betrays either the injustice
of the invalid, or his irritability. Your mind
is not clouded by any mist from the fever
marshes, but its sympathies are far more active
than they were. Your pain has taught
you a tender pity for all the pain that is outside
of you, and a patient gentleness which
was wanting to your nature in its days of barbarian
health.</p>

<p>Surely it would be a lamentable error if
mankind were to carry out the recommendation
of certain ruthless philosophers, and reject
the help and teaching of the diseased.
Without undervaluing the robust performance
of healthy natures, and without encouraging
literature that is morbid, that is fevered,
impatient, and perverse, we may still
prize the noble teaching which is the testament
of sufferers to the world. The diseased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
have a peculiar and mysterious experience;
they have known the sensations of health, and
then, in addition to this knowledge, they have
gained another knowledge which enables them
to think more accurately even of health itself.
A life without suffering would be like a picture
without shade. The pets of Nature, who
do not know what suffering is, and cannot
realize it, have always a certain rawness, like
foolish landsmen who laugh at the terrors of
the ocean, because they have neither experience
enough to know what those terrors are,
nor brains enough to imagine them.</p>

<p>You who are borne along, slowly but irresistibly,
to that Niagara which plunges into the
gulf of death,&mdash;you who, with perfect self-possession
and heroic cheerfulness, are counting
the last miles of the voyage,&mdash;find leisure to
study and think as the boat glides onwards
silently to the inevitable end. It is one of the
happiest privileges of the high intellectual life
that it can elevate us&mdash;at least in the intervals
of relief from complete prostration or acute
pain&mdash;to regions of disinterested thought,
where all personal anxieties are forgotten.
To feel that he is still able, even in days of
physical weakness and decline, to add something
to the world&rsquo;s inheritance of knowledge,
or to bequeath to it some new and noble
thought in the pearl of complete expression,
is a profound satisfaction to the active mind
that is lodged in a perishing body. Many
diseases fortunately permit this activity to
the last; and I do not hesitate to affirm, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
the work done in the time of physical decline
has in not a few instances been the most perfect
and the most permanently valuable. It
is not accurately true that the mind and the
body invariably fail together. Physicians
who know how prevalent chronic diseases
are, and how many eminent men are physically
inconvenienced by them, know also
that minds of great spiritual energy possess
the wonderful faculty of indefinitely improving
themselves whilst the body steadily deteriorates.
Nor is there anything irrational
in this persistent improvement of the mind,
even to the extremest limit of material decay;
for the mind of every intellectual human
being is part and parcel of the great permanent
mind of humanity; and even if its influence
soon ceases to be traceable&mdash;if the
spoken words are forgotten&mdash;if the written
volume is not reprinted or even quoted, it
has not worked in vain. The intellectual
light of Europe in this century is not only
due to great luminaries whom every one can
name, but to millions of thoughtful persons,
now utterly forgotten, who in their time
loved the light, and guarded it, and increased
it, and carried it into many lands, and bequeathed
it as a sacred trust. He who labors
only for his personal pleasure may well
be discouraged by the shortness and uncertainty
of life, and cease from his selfish toil
on the first approaches of disease; but whoever
has fully realized the grand continuity
of intellectual tradition, and taken his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
place in it between the future and the past,
will work till he can work no more, and then
gaze hopefully on the world&rsquo;s great future,
like Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, when his blind
eyes beheld the future of zoology.</p>

<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG MAN OF BRILLIANT ABILITY, WHO HAD JUST TAKEN HIS DEGREE.</h5>

<p class="pro">A domestic picture&mdash;Thoughts suggested by it&mdash;Importance
of the senses in intellectual pursuits&mdash;Importance of
hearing to Madame de Stael&mdash;Importance of seeing to Mr.
Buskin&mdash;Mr. Prescott, the historian&mdash;How blindness retarded
his work&mdash;Value of all the five senses&mdash;Self-government
indispensable to their perfection&mdash;Great value of
longevity to the intellectual life.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is always a great pleasure to me to pass
an evening at your father&rsquo;s house; but on the
last occasion that pleasure was very much
enhanced because you were once more with
us. I watched your mother&rsquo;s eyes as she sat
in her place in the drawing-room. They followed
you almost without ceasing, and there
was the sweetest, happiest expression on her
dear face, that betrayed her tender maternal
love for you and her legitimate maternal
pride. Your father was equally happy in his
own way; he was much more gay and talkative
than I have seen him for two or three anxious
years; he told amusing stories; he entered
playfully into the jests of others; he had
pleasant projects for the future, and spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
of them with facetious exaggeration. I sat
quietly in my corner, slyly observing my old
friends, and amusing myself by discovering
(it did not need much perspicacity for that)
the hidden sources of the happiness that was
so clearly visible. They were gladdened by
the first successes of your manhood; by the
evidence of your strength; by the realization
of hopes long cherished.</p>

<p>Watching this charming picture with a
perfect sympathy, I began to have certain
thoughts of my own which it is my present
purpose to communicate to you without disguise.
I thought, first, how agreeable it was
to be the spectator of so pretty a picture; but
then my eyes wandered to a painting that
hung upon the walls, in which also there were
a mother and her son, and this led me a long
way. The painting was a hundred years old;
but although the colors were not quite so fresh
as when they left the palette of the artist, the
beautiful youth who stood radiant like a
young Apollo in the centre of the composition
had not lost one of the great gifts with which
his cunning human creator had endowed him.
The fire of his eye had not been quenched by
time; the bloom of his cheek still flushed
with faint vermilion; his lip was full and
imperious; his limbs athletic; his bearing
haughty and dauntless. All life seemed
spread before him like a beautiful rich estate
of which every acre was his own. How easily
will he conquer fame! how easily kindle passion.
Who shall withstand this pink and perfection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
of aristocracy&mdash;this ideal of the age
of fine gentlemen, with all the gifts of nature
helped by all the inventions of art?</p>

<p>Then I thought farther: &ldquo;That splendid
young nobleman in the picture will look just
as young as he does now when we shall be
either superannuated or dead.&rdquo; And I looked
at you and your mother again and thought:
&ldquo;It is just five minutes since I saw these two
living beings, and in this little space of time
they have both of them aged a little, though
no human observer has enough delicacy of
perception to detect so inappreciable an alteration.&rdquo;
I went gradually on and on into the
future, trying to imagine the changes which
would come over yourself more especially (for
it was you who were the centre of my reverie),
till at last I imagined pretty accurately
what you might be at sixty; but there it became
necessary to stop, because it was too
difficult to conceive the processes of decay.</p>

<p>After this, one thought grew upon me and
became dominant. I thought, at present he
has all the senses in their perfection, and they
serve him without a hitch. He is an intelligence
served by organs, and the organs are
all doing their duty as faithfully as a postman
who brings letters. When the postman becomes
too infirm to do his work he will retire
on his little pension, and another will take his
place and bring the letters just as regularly;
but when the human organs become infirm
they cannot be taken out and replaced by
new ones, so that we must content ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
to the end, with their service, such as it may
be. Then I reflected how useful the senses
are to the high intellectual life, and how wise
it is, even for intellectual purposes, to preserve
them as long as possible in their perfection.</p>

<p>To be able to see and hear well&mdash;to feel
healthy sensations&mdash;even to taste and smell
properly, are most important qualifications
for the pursuit of literature, and art, and
science. If you read attentively the work of
any truly illustrious poet, you will find that
the whole of the imagery which gives power
and splendor to his verse is derived from nature
through one or other of these ordinary
channels. Some philosophers have gone much
farther than this, and have affirmed that the
entire intellectual life is based ultimately upon
remembered physical sensations; that we
have no mental conception that is really independent
of sensuous experience; and that the
most abstract thought is only removed from
sensation by successive processes of substitution,
I have not space to enter into so great
and mysterious a subject as this; but I desire
to draw your attention to a truth very commonly
overlooked by intellectual people,
which is the enormous importance of the
organs of sense in the highest intellectual
pursuits. I will couple together two names
which have owed their celebrity, one chiefly
to the use of her ears, the other to the use of
his eyes. Madame de Stael obtained her literary
material almost exclusively by means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
of conversation. She directed, systematically,
the talk of the learned and brilliant
men amongst whom she lived to the subject
which for the moment happened to occupy
her thoughts. Her literary process (which is
known to us in detail through the revelations
of her friends) was purposely invented to
catch everything that she heard, as a net
catches fish in a river. First, she threw down
on paper a very brief rough draft of the intended
literary project. This she showed to
few, but from it she made a second &ldquo;state&rdquo;
(as an engraver would say), which she exhibited
to some of her trusted friends, profiting
by their hints and suggestions. Her secretary
copied the corrected manuscript, incorporating
the new matter, on paper with a
very broad margin for farther additions.
During all the time that it took to carry her
work through these successive states, that ingenious
woman made the best possible use of
her ears, which were her natural providers.
She made everybody talk who was likely to be
of any use to her, and then immediately added
what she had caught on the wide margin reserved
for that purpose. She used her eyes
so little that she might almost as well have
been blind. We have it on her own authority,
that were it not out of respect to custom,
she would not open her window to see the
Bay of Naples for the first time, whereas she
would travel five hundred leagues to talk with
a clever man whom she had never met.</p>

<p>Now since Madame de Stael&rsquo;s genius fed itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
exclusively through the faculty of hearing,
what an enormous difference it would
have made to her if she had been deaf! It is
probable that the whole of her literary reputation
was dependent on the condition of her
ears. Even a very moderate degree of deafness
(just enough to make listening irksome)
might have kept her in perpetual obscurity.</p>

<p>The next instance I intend to give is that of
a distinguished contemporary, Mr. Ruskin.
His peculiar position in literature is due to his
being able to see as cultivated artists see.
Everything that is best and most original in
his writings is invariably either an account of
what he has seen in his own independent inimitable
way, or else a criticism of the accurate
or defective sight of others. His method
of study, by drawing and taking written
memoranda of what he has seen, is entirely
different from Madame de Stael&rsquo;s method, but
refers always, as hers did, to the testimony
of the predominant sense. Every one whose
attention has been attracted to the subject is
aware that, amongst people who are commonly
supposed, to see equally well, and who
are not suspected of any tendency to blindness,
the degrees of perfection in this sense
vary to infinity. Suppose that Mr. Ruskin
(to our great misfortune) had been endowed
with no better eyes than many persons who
see fairly well in the ordinary sense, his enjoyment
and use of sight would have been so
much diminished that he would have had little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
enthusiasm about seeing, and yet that kind
of enthusiasm was quite essential to his work.</p>

<p>The well-known instance of Mr. Prescott,
the historian, is no doubt a striking proof
what <i>may</i> be accomplished by a man of remarkable
intellectual ability without the help
of sight, or rather helped by the sight of
others. We have also heard of a blind traveller,
and even of a blind entomologist; but in
all cases of this kind they are executive difficulties
to be overcome, such that only the
most resolute natures would ever dream of
encountering them. When the materials for
the &ldquo;Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella&rdquo; arrived
in Prescott&rsquo;s house from Europe, his
remaining eye had just suffered from over-exertion
to such a degree that he could not
use it again for years. &ldquo;I well remember,&rdquo;
he wrote in a letter to a friend, &ldquo;the blank
despair which I felt when my literary treasures
arrived, and I saw the mine of wealth
lying around me which I was forbidden to
explore.&rdquo; And although, by a most tedious
process, which would have worn out the patience
of any other author, Mr. Prescott did
at last arrive at the conclusion of his work, it
cost him ten years of labor&mdash;probably thrice
as much time as would have been needed by
an author of equal intellectual ability without
any infirmity of sight.</p>

<p>Although, of the five senses which God has
given us, sight and hearing are the most necessary
to the intellectual life, it may easily
be demonstrated that the lower ones are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
without their intellectual uses. Perfect literature
and art can only he produced by men
who are perfect in all their natural faculties.
The great creative intellects have never been
ascetics; they have been rightly and healthily
sensitive to every kind of pleasure. The taste
of fruits and wines, the perfume of flowers are
a part of the means by which the spirit of
Nature influences our most secret thoughts,
and conveys to us suggestions, or carries us
into states of feeling which have an enormous
effect upon our thinking, though the manner
in which the effect is produced is one of the
deepest mysteries of our mysterious being.
When the Caliph Vathek added five wings to
the palace of Alkoremmi, on the hill of Pied
Horses, for the particular gratification of
each of his five senses, he only did on a uselessly
large scale what every properly-endowed
human being does, when he can afford
it, on a small one.</p>

<p>You will not suspect me of preaching unlimited
indulgence. The very object of this
letter is to recommend, for intellectual purposes,
the careful preservation of the senses
in the freshness of their perfection, and this
is altogether incompatible with every species
of excess. If you are to see clearly all your
life, you must not sacrifice eyesight by over-straining
it; and the same law of moderation
is the condition of preserving every other
faculty. I want you to know the exquisite
taste of common dry bread; to enjoy the perfume
of a larch wood at a distance; to feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
delight when a sea-wave dashes over you. I
want your eye to be so sensitive that it shall
discern the faintest tones of a gray cloud, and
yet so strong that it shall bear to gaze on a
white one in the dazzling glory of sunshine.
I would have your hearing sharp enough to
detect the music of the spheres, if it were but
audible, and yet your nervous system robust
enough to endure the shock of the guns on an
ironclad. To have and keep these powers we
need a firmness of self-government that is rare.</p>

<p>Young men are careless of longevity; but
how precious are added years to the fulness
of the intellectual life! There are lives, such
as that of Major Pendennis, which only diminish
in value as they advance&mdash;when the man
of fashion is no longer fashionable, and the
sportsman can no longer stride over the
ploughed fields. The old age of the Major
Pendennises is assuredly not to be envied:
but how rich is the age of the Hunboldts! I
compare the life of the intellectual to a long
wedge of gold&mdash;the thin end of it begins at
birth, and the depth and value of it go on indefinitely
increasing till at last comes Death (a
personage for whom Nathaniel Hawthorne
had a peculiar dislike, for his unmannerly
habit of interruption), who stops the auriferous
processes. Oh, the mystery of the nameless
ones who have died when the wedge was
thin and looked so poor and light! Oh, the
happiness of the fortunate old men whose
thoughts went deeper and deeper like a wall
that runs out into the sea!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span> </p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;One of the most painful cases of interruption caused
by death is that of Cuvier. His paralysis came upon him
whilst he was still in full activity, and death prevented him
from arranging a great accumulation of scientific material.
He said to M. Pasquier, &ldquo;I had great things still to do; all
was ready in my head. After thirty years of labor and research,
there remained but to write, and now the hands fail,
and carry with them the head.&rdquo; But the most lamentable instances
of this kind of interruption are, from the nature of
things, unknown to us. Even the friends of the deceased
cannot estimate the extent of the loss, for a man&rsquo;s immediate
neighbors are generally the very last persons to become
aware of the nature of his powers or the value of his acquirements.</p></div>

<p class="pro">The love of intellectual pleasure&mdash;The seeking for a stimulus&mdash;Intoxication
of poetry and oratory&mdash;Other mental intoxications&mdash;The
Bishop of Exeter on drudgery&mdash;The labor
of composition in poetry&mdash;Wordsworth&rsquo;s dread of it&mdash;Moore&mdash;His
trouble with &ldquo;Lalla Rookh&rdquo;&mdash;His painstaking
in preparation&mdash;Necessity of patient industry in other

struggling against technical difficulties&mdash;Water-color
painting, etching, oil-painting, fresco, line-engraving&mdash;Labor
undergone for mere discipline&mdash;Moral strength of
students&mdash;Giordano Bruno.</p>

<p><span class="sc">You</span> told me the other day that you believed
the inducement to what I called intellectual
living to be merely the love of pleasure&mdash;pleasure
of a higher kind, no doubt, than
that which we derive from wine, yet fairly
comparable to it. You went on to say that
you could not, from the moral point of view,
discern any appreciable difference between
intoxicating oneself by means of literature or
art and getting tipsy on port wine or brandy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
that the reading of poetry, most especially
was clearly self-intoxication&mdash;a service of Venus
and Bacchus, in which the suggestions of
artfully-ordered words were used as substitutes
for the harem and the wine-flask. Completing
the expression of this idea, you said
that the excitement produced by oratory was
exactly of the same nature as the excitement
produced by gin, so that Mr. Bright and M.
Gambetta&mdash;nay, even a gentleman so respectable
as the late Lord Derby&mdash;belonged strictly
to the same profession as the publicans, being
dealers in stimulants, and no more. The
habitual student was, in your view, nothing
better than the helpless victim of unresisted
appetite, to whom intellectual intoxication,
having been at first a pleasure, had finally
become a necessity. You added that any rational
person who found himself sinking into
such a deplorable condition as this, would
have recourse to some severe discipline as a
preservative&mdash;a discipline requiring close attention
to common things, and rigorously excluding
every variety of thought which could
possibly be considered intellectual.</p>

<p>It is strictly true that the three intellectual
pursuits&mdash;literature, science, and the fine arts&mdash;are
all of them strong stimulants, and that
men are attracted to them by the stimulus
they give. But these occupations are morally
much nearer to the common level of other occupations
than you suppose. There is no
doubt a certain intoxication in poetry and
painting; but I have seen a tradesman find a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
fully equivalent intoxication in an addition
of figures showing a delightful balance at his
banker&rsquo;s. I have seen a young poet intoxicated
with the love of poetry; but I have also
seen a young mechanical genius on whom the
sight of a locomotive acted exactly like a bottle
of champagne. Everything that is capable
of exciting or moving man, everything
that fires him with enthusiasm, everything
that sustains his energies above the dead
level of merely animal existence, may be
compared, and not very untruly, to the action
of generous wine. The two most powerful
mental stimulants&mdash;since they overcome even
the fear of death&mdash;are unquestionably religion
and patriotism: ardent states of feeling
both of them when they are genuine; yet this
ardor has a great utility. It enables men to
bear much, to perform much which would be
beyond their natural force if it were not sustained
by powerful mental stimulants. And
so it is in the intellectual life. It is because
its labors are so severe that its pleasures are
so glorious. The Creator of intellectual man
set him the most arduous tasks&mdash;tasks that required
the utmost possible patience, courage,
self-discipline, and which at the same time
were for the most part, from their very nature,
likely to receive only the most meagre
and precarious pecuniary reward. Therefore,
in order that so poor and weak a creature
might execute its gigantic works with
the energy necessary to their permanence,
the labor itself was made intensely attractive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
and interesting to the few who were fitted for
it by their constitution. Since their courage
could not be maintained by any of the common
motives which carry men through ordinary
drudgery&mdash;since neither wealth nor
worldly position was in their prospects, the
drudgery they had to go through was to be
rewarded by the triumphs of scientific discovery,
by the felicities of artistic expression. A
divine drunkenness was given to them for
their encouragement, surpassing the gift of
the grape.</p>

<p>But now that I have acknowledged, not ungratefully,
the necessity of that noble excitement
which is the life of life, it is time for me
to add that, in the daily labor of all intellectual
workers, much has to be done which requires
a robustness of the moral constitution beyond
what you appear to be aware of. It is not
long since the present Bishop of Exeter truly
affirmed, in an address to a body of students,
that if there were not weariness in work, that
work was not so thorough-going as it ought
to be. &ldquo;Of all work,&rdquo; the Bishop said, &ldquo;that
produces results, nine-tenths must be drudgery.
There is no work, from the highest to
the lowest, which can be done well by any
man who is unwilling to make that sacrifice.
Part of the very nobility of the devotion of
the true workman to his work consists in the
fact that a man is not daunted by finding
that drudgery must be done; and no man
can really succeed in any walk of life without
a good deal of what in ordinary English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
is called pluck. That is the condition of all
work whatever, and it is the condition of all
success. And there is nothing which so truly
repays itself as this very perseverance against
weariness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You understand, no doubt, that there is
drudgery in the work of a lawyer or an accountant,
but you imagine that there is no
drudgery in that of an artist, or author, or
man of science. In these cases you fancy
that there is nothing but a pleasant intoxication,
like the puffing of tobacco or the sipping
of claret after dinner. The Bishop sees more
accurately. He knows that &ldquo;of <i>all</i> work
that produces results nine-tenths must be
drudgery.&rdquo; He makes no exceptions in favor
of the arts and sciences; if he had made any
such exceptions, they would have proved the
absence of culture in himself. Real work of
all descriptions, even including the composition
of poetry (the most intoxicating of all
human pursuits), contains drudgery in so
large a proportion that considerable moral
courage is necessary to carry it to a successful
issue. Some of the most popular writers
of verse have dreaded the labor of composition.
Wordsworth shrank from it much
more sensitively than he did from his prosaic
labors as a distributor of stamps. He had
that <i>horreur de la plume</i> which is a frequent
malady amongst literary men. But we feel, in
reading Wordsworth, that composition was a
serious toil to him&mdash;the drudgery is often
visible. Let me take, then, the case of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
writer of verse distinguished especially for
fluency and ease&mdash;the lightest, gayest, apparently
most thoughtless of modern minstrels&mdash;the
author of &ldquo;The Irish Melodies&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Lalla Rookh.&rdquo; Moore said&mdash;I quote from
memory and may not give the precise words,
but they were to this effect&mdash;that although
the first shadowy imagining of a new poem
was a delicious fool&rsquo;s paradise, the labor of
actual composition was something altogether
different. He did not, I believe, exactly use
the word &ldquo;drudgery,&rdquo; but his expression implied
that there was painful drudgery in the
work. When he began to write &ldquo;Lalla
Rookh&rdquo; the task was anything but easy to
him. He said that he was &ldquo;at all times a far
more slow and painstaking workman than
would ever be guessed from the result.&rdquo; For
a long time after the conclusion of the agreement
with Messrs. Longman, &ldquo;though generally
at work with a view to this task, he made
but very little real progress in it.&rdquo; After
many unsatisfactory attempts, finding that
his subjects were so slow in kindling his own
sympathies, he began to despair of their ever
touching the hearts of others. &ldquo;Had this series
of disheartening experiments been carried
on much further, I must have thrown aside
the work in despair.&rdquo; He took the greatest
pains in long and laboriously preparing himself
by reading. &ldquo;To form a storehouse, as
it were, of illustrations purely Oriental, and
so familiarize myself with its various treasures
that, quick as Fancy required the aid of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
fact in her spiritings, the memory was ready
to furnish materials for the spell-work; such
was, for a long while, the sole object of my
studies.&rdquo; After quoting some opinions favorable
to the truth of his Oriental coloring, he
says: &ldquo;Whatever of vanity there may be in
citing such tributes, they show, at least, of
what great value, even in poetry, is that prosaic
quality, industry, since it was in a slow
and laborious collection of small facts that the
first foundations of this fanciful romance
were laid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other fine arts make equally large claims
upon the industry of their professors. We
see the charming result, which looks as if it
were nothing but pleasure&mdash;the mere sensuous
gratification of an appetite for melody or
color; but no one ever eminently succeeded
in music or painting without patient submission
to a discipline far from attractive or entertaining.
An idea was very prevalent
amongst the upper classes in England, between
twenty and thirty years ago, that art
was not a serious pursuit, and that Frenchmen
were too frivolous to apply themselves
seriously to anything. When, however, the
different schools of art in Europe came to be
exhibited together, the truth began to dawn
upon people&rsquo;s minds that the French and
Belgian schools of painting had a certain superiority
over the rest&mdash;a superiority of quite
a peculiar sort; and when the critics applied
themselves to discover the hidden causes of
this generally perceived superiority, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
found out that it was due in great measure to
the patient drudgery submitted to by those
foreign artists in their youth. English painters
who have attained distinction have gone
through a like drudgery, if not in the public
<i>atelier</i> at least in secrecy and solitude. Mr.
John Lewis, in reply to an application for a
drawing to be reproduced by the autotype
process, and published in the <i>Portfolio</i>, said
that his sketches and studies were all in
color, but if we liked to examine them we
were welcome to select anything that might
be successfully photographed. Not being in
London at the time, I charged an experienced
friend to go and see if there were anything
that would answer our purpose. Soon afterward
he wrote: &ldquo;I have just been to see John
Lewis, and have come away <i>astounded</i>.&rdquo; He
had seen the vast foundations of private industry
on which the artist&rsquo;s public work had
been erected,&mdash;innumerable studies in color,
wrought with the most perfect care and finish,
and all for self-education merely, not for
any direct reward in fame. We have all admired
the extraordinary power of representation
in the little pictures of Meissonier; that
power was acquired by painting studies <i>life-size</i>
for self-instruction, and the artist has
sustained his knowledge by persistence in that
practice. Mulready, between the conception
of a new picture and the execution of it, used
to give himself a special training for the intended
work by painting a study in color of
every separate thing that was to form part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
of the composition. It is useless to go on
multiplying these examples, since all great
artists, without exception, have been distinguished
for their firm faith in steady well-directed
labor. This faith was so strong in Reynolds
that it limited his reasoning powers, and
prevented him from assigning their due importance
to the inborn natural gifts.</p>

<p>Not only in their preparations for work,
but even in the work itself, do artists undergo
drudgery. It is the peculiarity of their
work that, more than any other human work,
it displays whatever there may be in it of
pleasure and felicity, putting the drudgery as
much out of sight as possible; but all who
know the secrets of the studio are aware of
the ceaseless struggles against technical difficulty
which are the price of the charms that
pleasantly deceive us. The amateur tries to
paint in water-color, and finds that the gradation
of his sky will not come right; instead
of being a sound gradation like that of the
heavenly blue, it is all in spots and patches.
Then he goes to some clever artist who seems
to get the right thing with enviable ease. &ldquo;Is
my paper good? have my colors been properly
ground?&rdquo; The materials are sound
enough, but the artist confesses one of the
discouraging little secrets of his craft. &ldquo;The
fact is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;those spots that you complain
of happen to all of us, and very troublesome
they are, especially in dark tints; the
only way is to remove them as patiently as
we can, and it sometimes takes several days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
If one or two of them remain in spite of us,
we turn them into birds.&rdquo; In etching, the
most famous practitioners get into messes
with the treacherous chemistry of their acids,
and need an invincible patience. Even Méryon
was always very anxious when the time
came for confiding his work to what he called
the <i>traitresse liqueur</i>; and whenever I give a
commission to an etcher, I am always expecting
some such despatch as the following:
&ldquo;Plate utterly ruined in the biting. Very
sorry. Will begin another immediately.&rdquo;
We know what a dreadful series of mishaps
attended our fresco-painters at Westminster,
and now even the promising water-glass process,
in which Maclise trusted, shows the
bloom of premature decay. The safest and
best known of modern processes, simple oil-painting
has its own dangers also. The colors
sink and alter; they lose their relative values;
they lose their pearly purity, their glowing
transparence&mdash;they turn to buff and black.
The fine arts bristle all over with technical
difficulties, and are, I will not say the best
school of patience in the world, for many
other pursuits are also very good schools of
patience; but I will say, without much fear
of contradiction from anybody acquainted
with the subject, that the fine arts offer
drudgery enough, and disappointment enough,
to be a training both in patience and in humility.</p>

<p>In the labor of the line-engraver both these
qualities are developed to the pitch of perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
heroism. He sits down to a great surface of
steel or copper, and day by day, week after
week, month after month, ploughs slowly his
marvellous lines. Sometimes the picture before
him is an agreeable companion; he is in
sympathy with the painter; he enjoys every
touch that he has to translate. But sometimes,
on the contrary, he hates the picture,
and engraves it as a professional duty. I
happened to call upon a distinguished English
engraver&mdash;a man of the greatest taste and
knowledge, a refined and cultivated critic&mdash;and
I found him seated at work before a
thing which had nothing to do with fine art&mdash;a
medley of ugly portraits of temperance
celebrities on a platform. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said to
me sadly, &ldquo;you see the dark side of our profession;
fancy sitting down to a desk all day
long for two years together with that thing
to occupy your thoughts!&rdquo; How much moral
fibre was needed to carry to a successful
issue so repulsive a task as that! You may
answer that a stone-breaker on the roadside
surpasses my line-engraver both in patience
and in humility; but whereas the sensitiveness
of the stone-breaker has been deadened
by his mode of life, the sensitiveness of the
engraver has been continually fostered and
increased. An ugly picture was torture to
his cultivated eye, and he had to bear the
torture all day long, like the pain of an irritating
disease.</p>

<p>Still even the line-engraver has secret
sources of entertainment to relieve the mortal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
tedium of his task-work. The picture
may be hideous, but the engraver has hidden
consolations in the exercise of his wonderful
art. He can at least entertain himself with
feats of interpretative skill, with the gentle
treacheries of improving here and there upon
the hatefulness of the intolerable original.
He may congratulate himself in the evening,
that one more frightful hat or coat has been
got rid of; that the tiresome task has been reduced
by a space measurable in eights of an
inch. The heaviest work which shows progress
is not without <i>one</i> element of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of intellectual labor,
undergone simply for discipline, which shows
no present result that is appreciable, and
which therefore requires, in addition to patience
and humility, one of the noblest of the
moral virtues, faith. Of all the toils in which
men engage, none are nobler in their origin
or their aim than those by which they endeavor
to become more wise. Pray observe
that whenever the desire for greater wisdom
is earnest enough to sustain men in these
high endeavors, there must be both humility
and faith&mdash;the humility which acknowledges
present insufficiency, the faith that relies
upon the mysterious laws which govern our
intellectual being. Be sure that there has
been great moral strength in all who have
come to intellectual greatness. During some
brief moments of insight the mist has rolled
away and they have beheld, like a celestial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
city, the home of their highest aspirations;
but the cloud has gathered round them again,
and still in the gloom they have gone steadily
forwards, stumbling often, yet maintaining
their unconquerable resolution. It is to this
sublime persistence of the intellectual in other
ages that the world owes the treasures which
they won; it is by a like persistence that we
may hope to hand them down, augmented,
to the future. Their intellectual purposes did
not weaken their moral nature, but exercised
and exalted it. All that was best and highest
in the imperfect moral nature of Giordano
Bruno had its source in that noble passion for
Philosophy, which made him declare that for
her sake it was easy to endure labor and pain
and exile, since he had found &ldquo;in brevi labore
diuturnam requiem, in levi dolore immensum
gaudium, in angusto exilio patriam amplissimam.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<h5>TO AN UNDISCIPLINED WRITER.</h5>

<p class="pro">Early indocility of great workers&mdash;External discipline only
a substitute for inward discipline&mdash;Necessity for inward
discipline&mdash;Origin of the idea of discipline&mdash;Authors peculiarly
liable to overlook its uses&mdash;Good examples&mdash;Sir Arthur
Helps&mdash;Sainte-Beuve&mdash;The central authority in the
mind&mdash;Locke&rsquo;s opinion&mdash;Even the creative faculty may
be commanded&mdash;Charles Baudelaire&mdash;Discipline in common
trades and professions&mdash;Lawyers and surgeons&mdash;Haller&mdash;Mental
refusals not to be altogether disregarded&mdash;The
idea of discipline the moral basis of the intellectual
life&mdash;Alexander Humboldt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir Arthur Helps</span>, in that wise book of his
&ldquo;Thoughts upon Government,&rdquo; says that
&ldquo;much of the best and greatest work in the
world has been done by those who were anything
but docile in their youth.&rdquo; He believes
that &ldquo;this bold statement applies not only to
the greatest men in Science, Literature, and
Art, but also to the greatest men in official
life, in diplomacy, and in the general business
of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of us who were remarkable for our
indocility in boyhood, and remarkable for
nothing else, have found much consolation in
this passage. It is most agreeable to be told,
by a writer very eminent both for wisdom
and for culture, that our untowardness was a
hopeful sign. Another popular modern writer
has also encouraged us by giving a long
list of dunces who have become illustrious.</p>

<p>Yet, however flattering it may be to find
ourselves in such excellent company, at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
so far as the earlier half of life may be concerned,
we cannot quite forget the very numerous
instances of distinguished persons
who began by submitting to the discipline of
school and college, and gained honors and
reputation there, before encountering the
competition of the world.</p>

<p>The external discipline applied by schoolmasters
is a substitute for that inward discipline
which we all so greatly need, and
which is absolutely indispensable to culture.
Whether a boy happens to be a dunce at
school or a youth of brilliant promise, his
future intellectual career will depend very
much on his moral force. The distinguished
men who derived so little benefit from early
discipline have invariably subjected themselves
to a discipline of another kind which
prepared them for the labor of their manhood.
It may be a pure assumption to say
this, but the assumption is confirmed by
every instance that is known to me. Many
eminent men have undergone the discipline
of business, many like Franklin have been
self-disciplined, but I have never heard of a
person who had risen to intellectual eminence
without voluntary submission to an intellectual
discipline of some kind.</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, great pleasures attached
to the intellectual life, and quite peculiar
to it; but these pleasures are the support
of discipline and not its negation. They
give us the cheerfulness necessary for our
work, but they do not excuse us from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
work. They are like the cup of coffee served
to a soldier on duty, not like the opium which
incapacitates for everything but dreaming.</p>

<p>I have been led into these observations by a
perusal of the new book which you sent me.
It has many qualities which in a young writer
are full of promise. It is earnest, and lively,
and exuberant, but at the same time it is undisciplined.</p>

<p>Now I believe it may be affirmed, that although
there has been much literature in
former ages which was both vigorous and undisciplined,
still when an age presents, as ours
does, living examples of perfect intellectual
discipline, whoever falls below them in this
respect contents himself with the very kind
of inferiority which of all inferiorities is the
easiest to avoid. You cannot, by an effort of
the will, hope to rival the brilliance of a genius,
but you may quite reasonably expect to
obtain as complete a control over your own
faculties and your own work as any other
highly-cultivated person.</p>

<p>The origin of discipline is the desire to do
not merely our best with the degree of power
and knowledge which at the time we do actually
happen to possess, but with that which
we <i>might</i> possess if we submitted to the necessary
training. The powers given to us by
Nature are little more than a power to become,
and this becoming is always conditional
on some sort of exercise&mdash;what sort we have
to discover for ourselves.</p>

<p>No class of persons are so liable to overlook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
the uses of discipline as authors are. Anybody
can write a book, though few can write
that which deserves the name of literature.
There are great technical differences between
literature and book-making, but few can
clearly explain these differences, or detect, in
their own case, the absence of the necessary
qualities. In painting, the most perfect finish
is recognized at a glance, but the mind only
can perceive it in the book. It was an odd
notion of the authorities to exhibit literature
in the international exhibitions; but if they
could have made people see the difference between
sound and unsound workmanship in
the literary craft, they would have rendered
a great service to the higher intellectual discipline.
Sir Arthur Helps might have served
as an example to English writers, because he
has certain qualities in which we are grievously
deficient. He can say a thing in the
words that are most fit and necessary, and
then leave it. Sainte-Beuve would have been
another admirable example of self-discipline,
especially to Frenchmen, who would do well
to imitate him in his horror of the <i>á peu près</i>.
He never began to write about anything until
he had cleared the ground well before him.
He never spoke about any character or doctrine
that he had not bottomed (to use Locke&rsquo;s
word) as far as he was able. He had an extraordinary
aptitude for collecting exactly
the sort of material that he needed, for arranging
and classifying material, for perceiving
its mutual relations. Very few Frenchmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
have had Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s intense repugnance
to insufficiency of information and inaccuracy
of language. Few indeed are the
French journalists of whom it might be said,
as it may be truly said of Sainte-Beuve, that
he never wrote even an article for a newspaper
without having subjected his mind to a
special training for that particular article.
The preparations for one of his <i>Lundis</i> were
the serious occupation of several laborious
days; and before beginning the actual composition,
his mind had been disciplined into a
state of the most complete readiness, like the
fingers of a musician who has been practising
a piece before he executes it.</p>

<p>The object of intellectual discipline is the
establishment of a strong central authority
in the mind by which all its powers are regulated
and directed as the military forces of a
nation are directed by the strategist who arranges
the operations of a war. The presence
of this strong central authority is made manifest
in the unity and proportion of the results;
when this authority is absent (it is frequently
entirely absent from the minds of
undisciplined persons, especially of the female
sex), you have a chaos of complete confusion;
when the authority without being absent is
not strong enough to regulate the lively activity
of the intellectual forces, you have too
much energy in one direction, too little in another,
a brigade where a regiment could have
done the work, and light artillery where you
want guns of the heaviest calibre.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span> </p>

<p>To establish this central authority it is only
necessary, in any vigorous and sound mind,
to exercise it. Without such a central power
there is neither liberty of action nor security
of possession. &ldquo;The mind,&rdquo; says Locke,
&ldquo;should always be free and ready to turn itself
to the variety of objects that occur, and
allow them as much consideration as shall,
for that time, be thought fit. To be engrossed
so by one subject as not to be prevailed on to
leave it for another that we judge fitter for
our contemplation, is to make it of no use to
us. Did this state of mind always remain so,
every one would, without scruple, give it the
name of perfect madness; and whilst it does
last, at whatever intervals it returns, such a
rotation of thoughts about the same object no
more carries us forward toward the attainment
of knowledge, than getting upon a mill-horse
whilst he jogs on his circular track,
would carry a man on a journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Writers of imaginative literature have
found in practice that even the creative faculty
might be commanded. Charles Baudelaire,
who had the poetical organization with
all its worst inconveniencies, said nevertheless
that &ldquo;inspiration is decidedly the sister
of daily labor. These two contraries do not
exclude each other more than all the other
contraries which constitute nature. Inspiration
obeys like hunger, like digestion, like
sleep. There is, no doubt, in the mind a sort
of celestial mechanism, of which we need not
be ashamed, but we ought to make the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
use of it. If we will only live in a resolute
contemplation of next day&rsquo;s work, the daily
labor will serve inspiration.&rdquo; In cases where
discipline is felt to be very difficult, it is generally
at the same time felt to be very desirable.
George Sand complains that although
&ldquo;to overcome the indiscipline of her brain,
she had imposed upon herself a regular way
of living, and a daily labor, still twenty times
out of thirty she catches herself reading or
dreaming, or writing something entirely
apart from the work in hand.&rdquo; She adds that
without this frequent intellectual <i>flânerie</i>,
she would have acquired information which
has been her perpetual but unrealized desire.</p>

<p>It is the triumph of discipline to overcome
both small and great repugnances. We bring
ourselves, by its help, to face petty details
that are wearisome, and heavy tasks that are
almost <span class="correction" title="amended from appaling">appalling</span>. Nothing shows the power
of discipline more than the application of the
mind in the common trades and professions
to subjects which have hardly any interest in
themselves. Lawyers are especially admirable
for this. They acquire the faculty of
resolutely applying their minds to the dryest
documents, with tenacity enough to end in
the perfect mastery of their contents; a feat
which is utterly beyond the capacity of any
undisciplined intellect, however gifted by
Nature. In the case of lawyers there are frequent
intellectual repugnances to be overcome;
but surgeons and other men of science
have to vanquish a class of repugnances even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
less within the power of the will&mdash;the instinctive
physical repugnances. These are often
so strong as to seem apparently insurmountable,
but they yield to persevering discipline.
Although Haller surpassed his contemporaries
in anatomy, and published several important
anatomical works, he was troubled
at the outset with a horror of dissection beyond
what is usual with the inexperienced,
and it was only by firm self-discipline that he
became an anatomist at all.</p>

<p>There is, however, one reserve to be made
about discipline, which is this: We ought not
to disregard altogether the mind&rsquo;s preferences
and refusals, because in most cases they are
the indication of our natural powers. They
are not so always; many have felt attracted
to pursuits for which they had no capacity
(this happens continually in literature and
the fine arts), whilst others have greatly distinguished
themselves in careers which were
not of their own choosing, and for which they
felt no vocation in their youth. Still there exists
a certain relation between preference and
capacity, which may often safely be relied
upon when there are not extrinsic circumstances
to attract men or repel them. Discipline
becomes an evil, and a very serious evil, causing
immense losses of special talents to the
community, when it overrides the personal
preferences entirely. We are less in danger
of this evil, however, from the discipline which
we impose upon ourselves than from that
which is imposed upon us by the opinion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
the society in which we live. The intellectual
life has this remarkable peculiarity as to
discipline, that whilst very severe discipline is
indispensable to it, that which it really needs
is the obedience to an inward law, an obedience
which is not only compatible with revolt
against other people&rsquo;s notions of what the intellectual
man ought to think and do, but
which often directly leads to such revolt as its
own inevitable result.</p>

<p>In the attempt to subject ourselves to the
inward law, we may encounter a class of mental
refusals which indicate no congenital incapacity,
but prove that the mind has been incapacitated
by its acquired habits and its ordinary
occupations. I think that it is particularly
important to pay attention to this
class of mental refusals, and to give them the
fullest consideration. Suppose the case of a
man who has a fine natural capacity for painting,
but whose time has been taken up by
some profession which has formed in him mental
habits entirely different from the mental
habits of an artist. The inborn capacity for
art might whisper to this man, &ldquo;What if you
were to abandon your profession and turn
painter?&rdquo; But to this suggestion of the inborn
capacity the acquired unfitness would,
in a man of sense, most probably reply, &ldquo;No;
painting is an art bristling all over with the
most alarming technical difficulties, which I
am too lazy to overcome; let younger men attack
them if they like.&rdquo; Here is a mental refusal
of a kind which the severest self-disciplinarian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
ought to listen to. This is Nature&rsquo;s
way of keeping us to our specialities; she protects
us by means of what superficial moralists
condemn as one of the minor vices&mdash;the
disinclination to trouble ourselves without necessity,
when the work involves the acquisition
of new habits.</p>

<p>The moral basis of the intellectual life appears
to be the idea of discipline; but the discipline
is of a very peculiar kind, and varies
with every individual. People of original
power have to discover the original discipline
that they need. They pass their lives in
thoughtfully altering this private rule of conduct
as their needs alter, as the legislature of
a progressive State makes unceasing alterations
in its laws. When we look back upon
the years that are gone, this is our bitterest
regret, that whilst the precious time, the irrecoverable,
was passing by so rapidly, we were
intellectually too undisciplined to make the
best personal use of all the opportunities that
it brought. Those men may be truly esteemed
happy and fortunate who can say to themselves
in the evening of their days&mdash;&ldquo;I had so
prepared myself for every successive enterprise,
that when the time came for it to be
carried into execution my training ensured
success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had thought of some examples, and there
are several great men who have left us noble
examples of self-discipline; but, in the range
and completeness of that discipline, in the
foresight to discern what would be wanted, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
the humility to perceive that it was wanting,
in the resolution that it should <i>not</i> be wanting
when the time came that such knowledge or
faculty should be called for, one colossal figure
so far excels all others that I cannot write
down their names with that of Alexander
Humboldt. The world sees the intellectual
greatness of such a man, but does not see the
substantial moral basis on which the towering
structure rose. When I think of his noble
dissatisfaction with what he knew; his ceaseless
eagerness to know more, and know it better;
of the rare combination of teachableness
that despised no help (for he accepted without
jealousy the aid of everybody who could assist
him), with self-reliance that kept him always
calm and observant in the midst of personal
danger, I know not which is the more
magnificent spectacle, the splendor of intellectual
light, or the beauty and solidity of the
moral constitution that sustained it.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO A FRIEND WHO SUGGESTED THE SPECULATION
&ldquo;WHICH OF THE MORAL VIRTUES WAS MOST
ESSENTIAL TO THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE.&rdquo;</h5>

<p class="pro">The most essential virtue is disinterestedness&mdash;The other virtues
possessed by the opponents of intellectual liberty&mdash;The
Ultramontane party&mdash;Difficulty of thinking disinterestedly
even about the affairs of another nation&mdash;English
newspapers do not write disinterestedly about foreign affairs&mdash;Difficulty
of disinterestedness in recent history&mdash;Poets
and their readers feel it&mdash;Fine subjects for poetry
in recent events not yet available&mdash;Even history of past
times rarely disinterested&mdash;Advantages of the study of
the dead languages in this respect&mdash;Physicians do not
trust their own judgment about their personal health&mdash;The
virtue consists in endeavoring to be disinterested.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I think</span> there cannot be a doubt that the
most essential virtue is disinterestedness.</p>

<p>Let me tell you, after this decided answer,
what are the considerations which have led
me to it. I began by taking the other important
virtues one by one&mdash;industry, perseverance,
courage, discipline, humility, and the
rest; and then asked myself whether any
class of persons possessed and cultivated
these virtues who were nevertheless opposed
to intellectual liberty. The answer came immediately,
that there have in every age been
men deservedly respected for these virtues
who did all in their power to repress the free
action of the intellect. What is called the
Ultramontane party in the present day includes
great numbers of talented adherents
who are most industrious, most persevering,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
who willingly submit to the severest discipline&mdash;who
are learned, self-denying, and
humble enough to accept the most obscure
and ill-requited duties. Some of these men
possess nine-tenths of the qualifications that
are necessary to the highest intellectual life&mdash;they
have brilliant gifts of nature; they are
well-educated; they take a delight in the exercise
of noble faculties, and yet instead of
employing their time and talents to help the
intellectual advancement of mankind, they
do all in their power to retard it. They have
many most respectable virtues, but one is
wanting. They have industry, perseverance,
discipline, but they have <i>not</i> disinterestedness.</p>

<p>I do not mean disinterestedness in its ordinary
sense as the absence of selfish care about
money. The Church of Rome has thousands
of devoted servants who are content to labor
in her cause for stipends so miserable that it
is clear they have no selfish aim; whilst they
abandon all those possibilities of fortune
which exist for every active and enterprising
layman. But their thinking can never be
disinterested so long as their ruling motive is
devotion to the interests of their Church.
Some of them are personally known to me,
and we have discussed together many of the
greatest questions which agitate the continental
nations at the present time. They
have plenty of intellectual acumen; but
whenever the discussion touches, however remotely,
the ecclesiastical interests that are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
dear to them, they cease to be observers&mdash;they
become passionate advocates. It is this
habit of advocacy which debars them from
all elevated speculation about the future of
the human race, and which so often induces
them to take a side with incapable and retrograde
governments, too willingly overlooking
their deficiencies in the expectation of
services to the cause. Their predecessors
have impeded, as far as they were able, the
early growth of science&mdash;not for intellectual
reasons, but because they instinctively felt
that there was something in the scientific
spirit not favorable to those interests which
they placed far above the knowledge of mere
matter.</p>

<p>I have selected the Ultramontane party in
the Church of Rome as the most prominent
example of a party eminent for many intellectual
virtues, and yet opposed to the intellectual
life from its own want of disinterestedness.
But the same defect exists, to some degree,
in every partisan&mdash;exists in you and
me so far as we are partisans. Let us suppose,
for example, that we desired to find out
the truth about a question much agitated in a
neighboring country at the present time&mdash;the
question whether it would be better for that
country to attempt the restoration of its ancient
Monarchy or to try to consolidate a Republican
form of government. How difficult
it is to think out such a problem disinterestedly,
and yet how necessary to the justice of
our conclusions that we should think disinterestedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
if we pretend to think at all! It is
true that we have one circumstance in our
favor&mdash;we are not French subjects, and this
is much. Still we are not disinterested, since
we know that the settlement of a great political
problem such as this, even though on
foreign soil, cannot fail to have a powerful
influence on opinion in our own country, and
consequently upon the institutions of our native
land. We are spectators only, it is true;
but we are far from being disinterested spectators.
And if you desire to measure the exact
degree to which we are interested in the
result, you need only look at the newspapers.
The English newspapers always treat French
affairs from the standpoint of their own
party. The Conservative journalist in England
is a Monarchist in France, and has no
hopes for the Republic; the Liberal journalist
in England believes that the French dynasties
are used up, and sees no chance of tranquillity
outside of republican institutions. In
both cases there is an impediment to the intellectual
appreciation of the problem.</p>

<p>This difficulty is so strongly felt by those
who write and read the sort of literature
which aspires to permanence, and which,
therefore, ought to have a substantial intellectual
basis, that either our distinguished
poets choose their subjects in actions long
past and half-forgotten, or else, when tempted
by present excitement, they produce work
which is artistically far inferior to their best.
Our own generation has witnessed three remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
events which are poetical in the
highest degree. The conquest of the Two
Sicilies by Garibaldi is a most perfect subject
for a heroic poem; the events which led to
the execution of the Emperor Maximilian and
deprived his Empress of reason, would, in the
hands of a great dramatist, afford the finest
possible material for a tragedy; the invasion
of France by the Germans, the overthrow of
Napoleon III., the siege of Paris, are an epic
ready to hand that only awaits its Homer;
yet, with the exception of Victor Hugo, who
is far gone in intellectual decadence, no great
poet has sung of these things yet. The subjects
are as good as can be, but too near.
Neither poet nor reader is disinterested
enough for the intellectual enjoyment of
these subjects: the poet would not see his way
clearly, the reader would not follow unreservedly.</p>

<p>It may be added, however, in this connection,
that even past history is hardly ever
written disinterestedly. Historians write with
one eye on the past and the other on the
pre-occupations of the present. So far as
they do this they fall short of the intellectual
standard. An ideally perfect history would
tell the pure truth, and all the truth, so far as
it was ascertainable.</p>

<p>Artists are seldom good critics of art, because
their own practice biasses them, and
they are not disinterested. The few artists
who have written soundly about art have
succeeded in the difficult task of detaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
saying from doing; they have, in fact, become
two distinct persons, each oblivious of
the other.</p>

<p>The strongest of all the reasons in favor of
the study of the dead languages and the literatures
preserved in them, has always appeared
to me to consist in the more perfect
disinterestedness with which we moderns can
approach them. The men and events are separated
from us by so wide an interval, not
only of time and locality, but especially of
modes of thought, that our passions are not
often enlisted, and the intellect is sufficiently
free.</p>

<p>It may be noted that medical men, who are
a scientific class, and therefore more than
commonly aware of the great importance of
disinterestedness in intellectual action, never
trust their own judgment when they feel the
approaches of disease. They know that it is
difficult for a man, however learned in medicine,
to arrive at accurate conclusions about
the state of a human body that concerns him
so nearly as his own, even although the person
who suffers has the advantage of actually experiencing
the morbid sensations.</p>

<p>To all this you may answer that intellectual
disinterestedness seems more an accident of
situation than a virtue. The virtue is not to
have it, but to seek it in all earnestness; to be
ready to accept the truth even when it is most
unfavorable to ourselves. I can illustrate my
meaning by a reference to a matter of everyday
experience. There are people who cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
bear to look into their own accounts from a
dread that the clear revelation of figures may
be less agreeable to them than the illusions
which they cherish. There are others who
possess a kind of virtue which enables them
to see their own affairs as clearly as if they
had no personal interest in them. The weakness
of the first is one of the most fatal of intellectual
weaknesses; the mental independence
of the second is one of the most desirable
of intellectual qualities. The endeavor to
attain it, or to strengthen it, is a great virtue,
and of all the virtues the one most indispensable
to the nobility of the intellectual life.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;The reader may feel some surprise that I have not
mentioned honesty as an important intellectual virtue. Honesty
is of great importance, no doubt, but it appears to be (as
to practical effects) included in disinterestedness, and to be
less comprehensively useful. There is no reason to suspect
the honesty of many political and theological partisans, yet
their honesty does not preserve them from the worst intellectual
habits, such as the habit of &ldquo;begging the question,&rdquo; of misrepresenting
the arguments on the opposite side, of shutting
their eyes to every fact which is not perfectly agreeable to
them. The truth is, that mere honesty, though a most respectable
and necessary virtue, goes a very little way toward
the forming of an effective intellectual character. It is valuable
rather in the relations of the intellectual man to the outer
world around him, and even here it is dangerous unless tempered
by discretion. A perfect disinterestedness would ensure
the best effects of honesty, and yet avoid some serious
evils, against which honesty is not, in itself, a safeguard.

<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>TO A MORALIST WHO SAID THAT INTELLECTUAL
CULTURE WAS NOT CONDUCIVE TO SEXUAL
MORALITY.</h5>

<p class="pro">That the Author does not write in the spirit of advocacy&mdash;Two
different kinds of immorality&mdash;Byron and Shelley&mdash;A peculiar
temptation for the intellectual&mdash;A distinguished
foreign writer&mdash;Reaction to coarseness from over-refinement&mdash;Danger
of intellectual excesses&mdash;Moral utility of
culture&mdash;The most cultivated classes at the same time the
most moral&mdash;That men of high intellectual aims have an
especially strong reason for morality&mdash;M. Taine&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p><span class="sc">A critic</span> in one of the quarterlies once
treated me as a feeble defender of my opinions,
because I gave due consideration to both sides
of a question. He said that, like a wise commander,
I capitulated beforehand in case my
arguments did not come up for my relief; nay,
more, that I gave up my arms in unconditional
surrender. To this let me answer, that
I have nothing to do with the polemical
method, that I do not look upon an opponent
as an enemy to be repelled, but as a torch-bearer
to be welcomed for any light that he
may bring; that I defend nothing, but try to
explore everything that lies near enough.</p>

<p>You need not expect me, therefore, to defend
very vigorously the morality of the intellectual
life. An advocate could do it brilliantly;
there are plenty of materials, but so
clumsy an advocate as your present correspondent
would damage the best of causes by
unseasonable indiscretions. So I begin by admitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
that your accusations are most of
them well founded. Many intellectual people
have led immoral lives, others have led
lives which, although in strict conformity to
their own theories of morality, were in opposition
to the morality of their country and
their age. Byron is a good instance of the
first, and Shelley of the second. Byron
was really and knowingly immoral; Shelley,
on the other hand, hated what he considered
to be immorality, and lived a life as nearly
as possible in accordance with the moral ideal
in his own conscience; still he did not respect
the moral rule of his country, but lived with
Mary Godwin, whilst Harriet, his first wife,
was still alive. There is a clear distinction
between the two cases; yet both have the defect
that the person takes in hand the regulation
of his own morality, which it is hardly
safe for any one to do, considering the prodigious
force of passion.</p>

<p>I find even in the lives of intellectual people
a peculiar temptation to immorality from
which others are exempt. It is in their nature
to feel an eager desire for intellectual
companionship, and yet at the same time to
exhaust very rapidly whatever is congenial to
them in the intellect of their friends. They
feel a strong intellectual attraction to persons
of the opposite sex; and the idea of living
with a person whose conversation is believed
at the time to promise an increasing interest,
is attractive in ways of which those who
have no such wants can scarcely form a conception.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
A most distinguished foreign writer,
of the female sex, has made a succession
of domestic arrangements which, if generally
imitated by others, would be subversive of any
conceivable system of morality; and yet it is
clear in this case that the temptation was
chiefly, if not entirely, intellectual. The successive
companions of this remarkable woman
were all of them men of exceptional intellectual
power, and her motive for changing them
was an unbridled intellectual curiosity.</p>

<p>This is the sort of immorality to which cultivated
people are most exposed. It is dangerous
to the well-being of a community because
it destroys the sense of security on
which the idea of the family is founded. If
we are to leave our wives when their conversation
ceases to be interesting, the foundations
of the home will be unsafe. If they are to
abandon, us when we are dull, to go away with
some livelier and more talkative companion,
can we ever hope to retain them permanently?</p>

<p>There is another danger which must be
looked fairly in the face. When the lives of
men are refined beyond the real needs of
their organization, Nature is very apt to bring
about the most extraordinary reactions.
Thus the most exquisitely delicate artists in
literature and painting have frequently had
reactions of incredible coarseness. Within
the Châteaubriand of Atala there existed an
obscene Châteaubriand that would burst forth
occasionally in talk that no biographer could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
repeat. I have heard the same thing of the
sentimental Lamartine. We know that
Turner, dreamer of enchanted landscapes,
took the pleasures of a sailor on the spree.
A friend said to me of one of the most exquisite
living geniuses: &ldquo;You can have no conception
of the coarseness of his tastes; he associates
with the very lowest women, and enjoys
their rough brutality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These cases only prove, what I have always
willingly admitted, that the intellectual
life is not free from certain dangers if we
lead it too exclusively. Intellectual excesses,
by the excitement which they communicate
to the whole system, have a direct tendency
to drive men into other excesses, and a too
great refinement in one direction may produce
degrading reactions in another. Still
the cultivation of the mind, reasonably pursued,
is, on the whole, decidedly favorable to
morality; and we may easily understand
that it should be so, when we remember that
people have recourse to sensual indulgences
simply from a desire for excitement, whilst
intellectual pursuits supply excitement of a
more innocent kind and in the utmost variety
and abundance. If, instead of taking a
few individual instances, you broadly observe
whole classes, you will recognize the
moral utility of culture. The most cultivated
classes in our own country are also the most
moral, and these classes have advanced in
morality at the same time that they have advanced
in culture. English gentlemen of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
present day are superior to their forefathers
whom Fielding described; they are better
educated, and they read more; they are at the
same time both more sober and more chaste.</p>

<p>I may add that intellectual men have peculiar
and most powerful reasons for avoiding
the excesses of immorality, reasons which to
any one who has a noble ambition are quite
enough to encourage him in self-control.
Those excesses are the gradual self-destruction
of the intellectual forces, for they
weaken the spring of the mind, not leaving
it well enough to face the drudgery that is
inevitable in every career. Even in cases
where they do not immediately lead to visible
imbecility, they make the man less efficient
and less capable than he might have been;
and all experienced wrestlers with fate and
fortune know well that success has often, at
the critical time, depended upon some very
trifling advantage which the slightest diminution
of power would have lost to them. No
one knows the full immensity of the difference
between having power enough to make a little
headway against obstacles, and just falling
short of the power which is necessary at
the time. In every great intellectual career
there are situations like that of a steamer
with a storm-wind directly against her and
an iron-bound coast behind. If the engines
are strong enough to gain an inch an hour she
is safe, but if they lose there is no hope. Intellectual
successes are so rewarding that
they are worth any sacrifice of pleasure; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
sense of defeat is so humiliating that fair Venus
herself could not offer a consolation for
it. An ambitious man will govern himself
for the sake of his ambition, and withstand
the seductions of the senses. Can he be ever
strong enough, can his brain ever be lucid
enough for the immensity of the task before
him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Le jeune homme,&rdquo; says M. Taine, &ldquo;ignore
qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas de pire déperdition de forces,
que de tels commerces abaissent le c&oelig;ur,
qu&rsquo;après dix ans d&rsquo;une vie pareille il aura
perdu la moitié de sa volonté, que ses pensées
auront un arrière-goût habituel d&rsquo;amertume
et de tristesse, que son ressort intérieur sera
amolli ou faussé. Il s&rsquo;excuse à ses propres
yeux, en se disant qu&rsquo;un homme doit tout
toucher pour tout connaître. De fait, il apprend
la vie, mais bien souvent aussi il perd
l&rsquo;énergie, la chaleur d&rsquo;âme, la capacité d&rsquo;agir,
et à trente ans il n&rsquo;est plus bon qu&rsquo;à faire un
employé, un dilettante, ou un rentier.&rdquo;</p>

<h5>TO A FRIEND WHO RECOMMENDED THE AUTHOR

<p><span class="sc">I happened</span> one day to converse with an excellent
French cook about the delicate art
which he professed, and he comprised the
whole of it under two heads&mdash;the knowledge
of the mutual influences of ingredients, and
the judicious management of heat. It struck
me that there existed a very close analogy
between cookery and education; and, on following
out the subject in my own way, I
found that what he told me suggested several
considerations of the very highest importance
in the culture of the human intellect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span> </p>

hut in power, was the liver of a fowl; but
there were several other ingredients also, and
amongst these a leaf or two of parsley. He
told me that the influence of the parsley was
a good illustration of his theory about his art.
If the parsley were omitted, the flavor he
aimed at was not produced at all; but, on the
other hand, if the quantity of parsley was in
the least excessive, then the <i>gâteau</i> instead of
being a delicacy for <i>gourmets</i> became an uneatable
mess. Perceiving that I was really
interested in the subject, he kindly promised
a practical evidence of his doctrine, and the
next day intentionally spoiled his dish by a
trifling addition of parsley. He had not exaggerated
the consequences; the delicate flavor
entirely departed, and left a nauseous bitterness
in its place, like the remembrance of
an ill-spent youth.</p>

<p>And so it is, I thought, with the different
ingredients of knowledge which are so eagerly
and indiscriminately recommended. We are
told that we ought to learn this thing and
that, as if every new ingredient did not affect
the whole flavor of the mind. There is a sort
of intellectual chemistry which is quite as
marvellous as material chemistry, and a thousand
times more difficult to observe. One
general truth may, however, be relied upon
as surely and permanently our own. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
true that everything we learn affects the
<i>whole</i> character of the mind.</p>

<p>Consider how incalculably important becomes
the question of proportion in our knowledge,
and how that which we are is dependent
as much upon our ignorance as our science.
What we call ignorance is only a smaller proportion&mdash;what
we call science only a larger.
The larger quantity is recommended as an unquestionable
good, but the goodness of it is
entirely dependent on the mental product that
we want. Aristocracies have always instinctively
felt this, and have decided that a gentleman
ought not to know too much of certain
arts and sciences. The character which
they had accepted as their ideal would have
been destroyed by indiscriminate additions
to those ingredients of which long experience
had fixed the exact proportions. The same
feeling is strong in the various professions:
there is an apprehension that the disproportionate
knowledge may destroy the professional
nature. The less intelligent members
of the profession will tell you that they dread
an unprofessional use of time; but the more
thoughtful are not so apprehensive about
hours and days, <i>they</i> dread that sure transformation
of the whole intellect which follows
every increase of knowledge.</p>

<p>I knew an English author who by great
care and labor had succeeded in forming a
style which harmonized quite perfectly with
the character of his thinking, and served as
an unfailing means of communication with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
his readers. Every one recognized its simple
ease and charm, and he might have gone on
writing with that enviable facility had he
not determined to study Locke&rsquo;s philosophical
compositions. Shortly afterwards my
friend&rsquo;s style suddenly lost its grace; he began
to write with difficulty, and what he
wrote was unpleasantly difficult to read.
Even the thinking was no longer his own
thinking. Having been in too close communication
with a writer who was not a literary
artist, his own art had deteriorated in consequence.</p>

<p>I could mention an English landscape
painter who diminished the pictorial excellence
of his works by taking too much interest
in geology. His landscapes became geological
illustrations, and no longer held
together pictorially. Another landscape
painter, who began by taking a healthy delight
in the beauty of natural scenery, became
morbidly religious after an illness, and thenceforth
passed by the loveliest European scenery
as comparatively unworthy of his attention,
to go and make ugly pictures of places that
had sacred associations.</p>

<p>For people who produce nothing these risks
appear to be less serious; and yet there have
been admirable characters, not productive,
whose admirableness might have been lessened
by the addition of certain kinds of learning.
The last generation of the English country
aristocracy was particularly rich in characters
whose unity and charm was dependent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
upon the limitations of their culture, and
which would have been entirely altered, perhaps
not for the better, by simply knowing a
science or a literature that was closed to
them.</p>

<p>Abundant illustrations might be collected
in evidence of the well-known truth that the
burden of knowledge may diminish the energy
of action; but this is rather outside of
what we are considering, which is the influence
of knowledge upon the intellectual and
not the active life.</p>

<p>I regret very much not to be able to suggest
anything like a safe rule for the selection of
our knowledge. The most rational one which
has been hit upon as yet appears to be a simple
confidence in the feeling that we inwardly
want to know. If I feel the inward want for
a certain kind of knowledge, it may perhaps
be presumed that it would be good for me;
but even this feeling is not perfectly reliable,
since people are often curious about things
that do not closely concern them, whilst they
neglect what it is most important for them to
ascertain. All that I venture to insist upon
is, that we cannot learn any new thing without
changing our whole intellectual composition
as a chemical compound is changed by
another ingredient; that the mere addition of
knowledge may be good for us or bad for us;
and that whether it will be good or bad is usually
a more obscure problem than the enthusiasm
of educators will allow. That depends
entirely on the work we have to do. Men are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
qualified for their work by knowledge, but
they are also negatively qualified for it by
their ignorance. Nature herself appears to
take care that the workman shall not know
too much&mdash;she keeps him steadily to his task;
fixes him in one place mentally if not corporeally,
and conquers his restlessness by fatigue.
As we are bound to a little planet, and
hindered by impassable gulfs of space from
wandering in stars where we have no business,
so we are kept by the force of circumstances
to the limited studies that belong to
us. If we have any kind of efficiency, very
much of it is owing to our narrowness, which
is favorable to a powerful individuality.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is true, we meet with instances
of men remarkable for the extent of their
studies. Franz W&oelig;pke, who died in 1864,
was an extraordinary example of this kind.
In the course of a short life he became, although
unknown, a prodigy of various learning.
His friend M. Taine says that he was
erudite in many eruditions. His favorite
pursuit was the history of mathematics, but
as auxiliaries he had learned Arabic, and Persian,
and Sanskrit. He was classically educated,
he wrote and spoke the principal modern
languages easily and correctly;<a name="FnAnchor_1" id="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> his
printed works are in three languages. He
had lived in several nations, and known their
leading men of science. And yet this astonishing
list of acquirements may be reduced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
the exercise of two decided and natural tastes.
Franz W&oelig;pke had the gift of the linguist and
an interest in mathematics, the first serving
as auxiliary to the second.</p>

<p>Goethe said that &ldquo;a vast abundance of objects
must lie before us ere we can think upon
them.&rdquo; W&oelig;pke felt the need of this abundance,
but he did not go out of his way to find
it. The objectionable seeking after knowledge
is the seeking after the knowledge which does
not belong to us. In vain you urge me to
go in quest of sciences for which I have no
natural aptitude. Would you have me act
like that foolish camel in the Hebrew proverb,
which in going to seek horns lost his ears?</p>

more restricted field&mdash;Privilege of instant admission&mdash;Many
pursuits cannot be kept up simultaneously&mdash;The

the Romans were situated as to this&mdash;The privilege

learned and we attempt to learn.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> appears to be henceforth inevitable that
men should be unable to restrict themselves
to one or two pursuits, and you who are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
most respects a very perfect specimen of what
the age naturally produces in the way of culture,
have studied subjects so many and so
various that a mere catalogue of them would
astonish your grandfather if his shade could
revisit his old home. And yet your grandfather
was considered a very highly cultivated
gentleman according to the ideas and requirements
of his time. He was an elegant scholar,
but in Latin chiefly, for he said that he never
read Greek easily, and indeed he abandoned
that language entirely on leaving the University.
But his Latin, from daily use and practice
(for he let no day slip by without reading
some ancient author) and from the thoroughness
and accuracy of his scholarship, was
always as ready for service as the saddled
steeds of Branksome. I think he got more
culture, more of the best effects of good literature,
out of that one language than some
polyglots get out of a dozen. He knew no
modern tongue, he had not even the common
pretension to read a little French, and in his
day hardly anybody studied German. He
had no scientific training of any kind except
mathematics, in which I have heard him say
that he had never been proficient. Of the fine
arts his ignorance was complete, so complete
that I doubt if he could have distinguished
Rigaud from Reynolds, and he had never
played upon any musical instrument. The
leisure which he enjoyed during a long and
tranquil existence he gave entirely to Latin
and English literature, but of the two he enjoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
Latin the more, not with the preference
of a pedant, but because it carried him more
completely out of the present, and gave him
the refreshment of a more perfect change.
He produced on all who knew him the impression
of a cultivated gentleman, which he
was.</p>

<p>There is only an interval of one generation
between you and that good Latinist, but how
wide is the difference in your intellectual regimen?
You have studied&mdash;well, here is a little
list of what you have studied, and probably
even this is not complete:&mdash;</p>

<p>Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian,
mathematics, chemistry, mineralogy, geology,
botany, the theory of music, the practice
of music on two instruments, much theory
about painting, the practice of painting in oil
and water-color, photography, etching on copper,
etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>That is to say, six literatures (including
English), six sciences (counting mineralogy
and geology as one), and five branches or departments
of the fine arts.</p>

<p>Omitting English literature from our total,
as that may be considered to come by nature
to an Englishman, though any real proficiency
in it costs the leisure of years, we
have here no less than sixteen different pursuits.
If you like to merge the theory of
music and painting in the practice of those
arts, though as a branch of study the theory
is really distinct, we have still fourteen pursuits,
any one of which is enough to occupy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
the whole of one man&rsquo;s time. If you gave
some time daily to each of these pursuits, you
could scarcely give more than half an hour,
even supposing that you had no professional
occupation, and that you had no favorite
study, absorbing time to the detriment of the
rest.</p>

<p>Now your grandfather, though he would be
considered quite an ignorant country gentleman
in these days, had in reality certain intellectual
advantages over his more accomplished
descendant. In the first place, he entirely
escaped the sense of pressure, the feeling
of not having time enough to do what he
wanted to do. He accumulated his learning
as quietly as a stout lady accumulates her fat,
by the daily satisfaction of his appetite.
And at the same time that he escaped the
sense of pressure, he escaped also the miserable
sense of imperfection. Of course he did
not know Latin like an ancient Roman, but
then he never met with any ancient Romans
to humiliate him by too rapid and half-intelligible
conversation. He met the best Latinists
of his day; and felt himself a master
amongst masters. Every time he went into
his study, to pass delightful hours with the
noble authors that he loved, he knew that his
admission into that august society would be
immediate and complete. He had to wait in
no antechamber of mere linguistic difficulty,
but passed at once into the atmosphere of
ancient thought, and breathed its delicate
perfume. In this great privilege of instant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
admission the man of one study has always
the advantage of men more variously cultivated.
Their misfortune is to be perpetually
waiting in antechambers, and losing time in
them. Grammars and dictionaries are antechambers,
bad drawing and bad coloring are
antechambers, musical practice with imperfect
intonation is an antechamber. And the
worst is that even when a man, like yourself
for instance, of very various culture, has at
one time fairly penetrated beyond the antechamber,
he is not sure of admittance a year
hence, because in the mean time the door may
have been closed against him. The rule of
each separate hall or saloon of knowledge is
that he alone is to be instantly admitted who
calls there every day.</p>

<p>The man of various pursuits does not, in
any case, keep them up simultaneously; he is
led by inclination or compelled by necessity
to give predominance to one or another. If
you have fifteen different pursuits, ten of
them, at any given time, will be lying by
neglected. The metaphor commonly used in
reference to neglected pursuits is borrowed
from the oxidation of metal; it is said that
they become rusty. This metaphor is too
mild to be exact. Rust on metal, even on
polished steel, is easily guarded against by
care, and a gun or a knife does not need to be
constantly used to keep it from being pitted.
The gunsmith and the cutler know how to
keep these things, in great quantity, without
using them at all. But no one can retain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
knowledge without using it. The metaphor
fails still more seriously in perpetuating a
false conception of the deterioration of knowledge
through neglect. It is not simply a loss
of polish which takes place, not a loss of mere
surface-beauty, but absolute disorganization,
like the disorganization of a carriage when
the axle-tree is taken away. A rusty thing
may still be used, but a disorganized thing
cannot be used until the lost organ has been
replaced. There is no equivalent, amongst
ordinary material losses, to the intellectual
loss that we incur by ceasing from a pursuit.
But we may consider neglect as an enemy
who carries away the girths from our
saddles, the bits from our bridles, the oars
from our boats, and one wheel from each of
our carriages, leaving us indeed still nominally
possessors of all these aids to locomotion,
but practically in the same position as if we
were entirely without them. And as an
enemy counts upon the delays caused by
these vexations to execute his designs whilst
we are helpless, so whilst we are laboring to
replace the lost parts of our knowledge the
occasion slips by when we most need it. The
only knowledge which is available when it is
wanted is that which we habitually use.
Studies which from their nature cannot be
commonly used are always retained with
great difficulty. The study of anatomy is
perhaps the best instance of this; every one
who has attempted it knows with what difficulty
it is kept by the memory. Anatomists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
say that it has to be learned and forgotten six
times before it can be counted as a possession.
This is because anatomy lies so much outside
of what is needed for ordinary life that very
few people are ever called upon to use it except
during the hours when they are actually
studying it. The few who need it every day
remember is as easily as a man remembers
the language of the country which he inhabits.
The workmen in the establishment at
Saint Aubin d&rsquo;Écroville, where Dr. Auzoux
manufactures his wonderful anatomical models,
are as familiar with anatomy as a painter
is with the colors on his palette. <i>They</i> never
forget it. <i>Their</i> knowledge is never made
practically valueless by some yawning hiatus,
causing temporary incompetence and delay.</p>

<p>To have one favorite study and live in it
with happy familiarity, and cultivate every
portion of it diligently and lovingly, as a
small yeoman proprietor cultivates his own
land, this, as to study, at least, is the most
enviable intellectual life. But there is another
side to the question which has to be
considered.</p>

<p>The first difficulty for us is in our education.
Modern education is a beginning of
many things, and it is little more than a beginning.
&ldquo;My notion of educating my boy,&rdquo;
said a rich Englishman, &ldquo;is not to make him
particularly clever at anything during his minority,
but to make him overcome the rudimentary
difficulties of many things, so that
when he selects for himself his own line of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
culture in the future, it cannot be altogether
strange to him, whatever line he may happen
to select.&rdquo; A modern father usually allows
his son to learn many things from a feeling of
timidity about making a choice, if only one
thing had to be chosen. He might so easily
make a wrong choice! When the inheritance
of the human race was less rich, there was no
embarrassment of that kind. Look at the education
of an ancient Greek, at the education
of one of the most celebrated Athenians, a
man living in the most refined and intellectual
society, himself mentally and bodily the
perfect type of his splendid race, an eloquent
and powerful speaker, a most capable commander
both by sea and land&mdash;look at the
education of the brilliant Alcibiades! When
Socrates gave the list of the things that Alcibiades
had learned, Alcibiades could add to
it no other even nominal accomplishment, and
what a meagre, short catalogue it was! &ldquo;But
indeed I also pretty accurately know what
thou hast learned; thou wilt tell me if anything
has escaped my notice. Thou hast
learned then thy letters (<span class="grk" title="grammata">&#947;&#961;&#8048;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>), to play on
the cithara (<span class="grk" title="kitharizein">&#954;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>) and to wrestle (<span class="grk" title="palaiein">&#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#943;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>),
for thou hast not cared to learn to play upon
the flute. This is all that thou hast learned,
unless something has escaped me.&rdquo; The
<span class="grk" title="grammata">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> which Alcibiades had learned with a
master meant reading and writing, for he expressly
says later on, that as for speaking
Greek, <span class="grk" title="hellênizein">&#941;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, he learned that of no other
master than the people. An English education
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
equivalent to that of Alcibiades would
therefore consist of reading and writing,
wrestling and guitar-playing, the last accomplishment
being limited to very simple music.
Such an education was possible to an Athenian
(though it is fair to add that Socrates does
not seem to have thought much of it) because
a man situated as Alcibiades was situated in
the intellectual history of the world, had no
past behind him which deserved his attention
more than the present which surrounded him.
Simply to speak Greek, <span class="grk" title="hellênizein">&#7953;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, was really
then the most precious of all accomplishments,
and the fact that Alcibiades came by it easily
does not lessen its value. Amongst a people
like the Athenians, fond of intellectual talk,
conversation was one of the best and readiest
means of informing the mind, and certainly
the very best means of developing it. It was
not a slight advantage to speak the language
of Socrates, and have him for a companion.</p>

<p>The cleverest and most accomplished Romans
were situated rather more like ourselves,
or at least as we should be situated if we had not
to learn Latin and Greek, and if there were
no modern language worth studying except
French. They went to Greece to perfect
themselves in Greek, and improve their accent,
just as our young gentlemen go to Paris
or Touraine. Still, the burden of the past
was comparatively light upon their shoulders.
An Englishman who had attempted no more
than they were bound to attempt might be a
scholar, but he would not be considered so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
He might be a thorough scholar in French and
English,&mdash;that is, he might possess the cream
of two great literatures,&mdash;but he would be
spoken of as a person of defective education.
It is the fashion, for example, to speak of Sir
Walter Scott as a half-educated man, because
he did not know much Greek, yet Sir Walter
had studied German with success, and with
his habit of extensive reading, and his immense
memory, certainly knew incomparably
more about the generations which preceded
him than Horace knew of those which
preceded the Augustan era.</p>

<p>The privilege of limiting their studies, from
the beginning, to one or two branches of
knowledge, belonged to earlier ages, and
every successive accumulation of the world&rsquo;s
knowledge has gradually lessened it. Schoolboys
in our time are expected to know more,
or to have attempted to learn more, than the
most brilliant intellectual leaders of former
times. What English parent, in easy circumstances,
would be content that his son should
have the education of Alcibiades, or an education
accurately corresponding to that of
Horace, or to that which sufficed for Shakespeare?
Yet although the burdens laid upon
the memory have been steadily augmented,
its powers have not increased. Our brains
are not better constituted than those of our
forefathers, although where they learned one
thing we attempt to learn six. They learned
and we attempt to learn. The only hope for
us is to make a selection from the attempts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
our too heavily burdened youth, and in those
selected studies to emulate in after-life the
thoroughness of our forefathers.</p>

<h3>LETTER III</h3>

<h5>TO A FRIEND WHO STUDIED MANY THINGS.</h5>

<p class="pro">An idealized portrait&mdash;The scholars of the sixteenth
century&mdash;Isolated
students&mdash;French students of English when isolated
from Englishmen&mdash;How one of them read Tennyson&mdash;Importance
of sounds&mdash;Illusions of scholarship&mdash;Difficulty
of appreciating the sense&mdash;That Latin may still be
made a spoken language&mdash;The early education of Montaigne&mdash;A
contemporary instance&mdash;Dream of a Latin island&mdash;Rapid
corruption of a language taught artificially.</p>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> your answer to my letter about the multiplicity
of modern studies you tell me that
my portrait of your grandfather is considerably
idealized, and that, notwithstanding all
the respect which you owe to his memory, you
have convincing proof in his manuscript annotations
to Latin authors that his scholarship
cannot have been quite so thorough as I represented
it. You convey, moreover, though
with perfect modesty in form, the idea that
you believe your own Latin superior to your
grandfather&rsquo;s, notwithstanding the far greater
variety of your studies. Let me confess
that I <i>did</i> somewhat idealize that description
of your grandfather&rsquo;s intellectual life. I described
rather a life which might have been
than a life which actually was. And even this
&ldquo;might have been&rdquo; is problematical. It may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
be doubted whether any modern has ever
really mastered Latin. The most that can be
said is that a man situated like your grandfather,
without a profession, without our present
temptation to scatter effort in many pursuits,
and who made Latin scholarship his
unique intellectual purpose, would probably
go nearer to a satisfactory degree of attainment
than we whose time and strength have
been divided into so many fragments. But
the picture of a perfect modern Latinist is
purely ideal, and the prevalent notion of high
attainment in a dead language is not fixed
enough to be a standard, whilst if it were
fixed it would certainly be a very low standard.
The scholars of this century do not
write Latin except as a mere exercise; they
do not write books in Latin, and they never
speak it at all. They do not use the language
actively; they only read it, which is not
really using it, but only seeing how other men
have used it. There is the same difference
between reading a language and writing or
speaking it that there is between looking at
pictures intelligently and painting them.
The scholars of the sixteenth century spoke
Latin habitually, and wrote it with ease and
fluency. &ldquo;Nicholas Grouchy,&rdquo; says Montaigne,
&ldquo;who wrote a book <i>de Comitiis Romanorum</i>;
William Guerente, who has written a
commentary upon Aristotle; George Buchanan,
that great Scotch poet; and Marc Anthony
Muret, whom both France and Italy
have acknowledged for the best orator of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
time, my domestic tutors (at college), have
all of them often told me that I had in my infancy
that language so very fluent and ready
that they were afraid to enter into discourse
with me.&rdquo; This passage is interesting for two
reasons; it shows that the scholars of that
age spoke Latin; but it proves at the same
time that they cannot have been really masters
of the language, since they were &ldquo;afraid
to enter into discourse&rdquo; with a clever child.
Fancy an Englishman who professed to be a
French scholar and yet &ldquo;was afraid to enter
into discourse&rdquo; with a French boy, for fear he
should speak too quickly! The position of
these scholars relatively to Latin was in fact
too isolated for it to have been possible that
they should reach the point of mastery. Suppose
a society of Frenchmen, in some secluded
little French village where no Englishman
ever penetrates, and that these Frenchmen
learn English from dictionaries, and set themselves
to speak English with each other, without
anybody to teach them the colloquial language
or its pronunciation, without ever once
hearing the sound of it from English lips,
what sort of English would they create
amongst themselves? This is a question that
I happen to be able to answer very accurately,
because I have known two Frenchmen who
studied English literature just as the Frenchmen
of the sixteenth century studied the literature
of ancient Rome. One of them, especially,
had attained what would certainly
in the case of a dead language be considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
a very high degree of scholarship indeed.
Most of our great authors were known to him,
even down to the close critical comparison of
different readings. Aided by the most powerful
memory I ever knew, he had amassed
such stores that the acquisitions, even of cultivated
Englishmen, would in many cases
have appeared inconsiderable beside them.
But he could not write or speak English in a
manner tolerable to an Englishman; and although
he knew nearly all the words in the
language, it was dictionary knowledge, and
so different from an Englishman&rsquo;s apprehension
of the same words that it was only a sort
of pseudo-English that he knew, and not our
living tongue. His appreciation of our authors,
especially of our poets, differed so widely
from English criticism and English feeling
that it was evident he did not understand
them as we understand them. Two things especially
proved this: he frequently mistook
declamatory versification of the most mediocre
quality for poetry of an elevated order;
whilst, on the other hand, his ear failed to perceive
the music of the musical poets, as Byron
and Tennyson. How <i>could</i> he hear their music,
he to whom our English sounds were all
unknown? Here, for example, is the way he
read &ldquo;Claribel:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>This, as nearly as I have been able to render
it in English spelling, was the way in
which a French gentleman of really high
culture was accustomed to read English
poetry to himself. Is it surprising that he
should have failed to appreciate the music of
our musical verse? He did not, however,
seem to be aware that there existed any obstacle
to the accuracy of his decisions, but
gave his opinion with a good deal of authority,
which might have surprised me had I not
so frequently heard Latin scholars do exactly
the same thing. My French friend read
&ldquo;Claribel&rdquo; in a ridiculous manner; but English
scholars all read Latin poetry in a manner
not less ridiculous. You laugh to hear
&ldquo;Claribel&rdquo; read with a foreign pronunciation,
and you see at once the absurdity of
affecting to judge of it as poetry before the
reader has learned to pronounce the sounds;
but you do not laugh to hear Latin poetry
read with a foreign pronunciation, and you
do not perceive that we are all of us disqualified,
by our profound ignorance of the pronunciation
of the ancient Romans, for any
competent criticism of their verse. In all
poetry, in all oratory, in much of the best
and most artistic prose-writing also, sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
has a great influence upon sense: a great
deal is conveyed by it, especially in the way
of feeling. If we do not thoroughly know
and practise the right pronunciation (and by
the right pronunciation I mean that which
the author himself <i>thought in</i> whilst he
wrote), we miss those delicate tones and cadences
which are in literature like the modulations
of the voice in speech. Nor can we
properly appreciate the artistic choice of
beautiful names for persons and places unless
we know the sounds of them quite accurately,
and have already in our minds the associations
belonging to the sounds. Names which
are selected with the greatest care by our
English poets, and which hold their place
like jewels on the finely-wrought texture of
the verse, lose all their value when they are
read with a vicious foreign pronunciation.
So it must be with Latin poetry when read
by an Englishman, and it is probable that we
are really quite insensible to the delicate art
of verbal selection as it was practised by the
most consummate masters of antiquity.</p>

<p>I know that scholars think that they hear
the Roman music still; but this is one of the
illusions of scholarship. In each country
Latin scholars have adopted a conventional
style of reading, and the sounds which are in
conformity with that style seem to them to
be musical, whilst other than the accepted
sounds seem ridiculous, and grate harshly on
the unaccustomed ear. The music which the
Englishman hears, or imagines that he hears,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
in the language of ancient Rome, is certainly
not the music which the Roman authors intended
to note in words. It is as if my
Frenchman, having read &ldquo;Claribel&rdquo; in his
own way, had affirmed that he heard the music
of the verse. If he heard music at all, it
was not Tennyson&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Permit me to add a few observations about
sense. My French friend certainly understood
English in a very remarkable manner
for a student who had never visited our country;
he knew the dictionary meaning of every
word he encountered, and yet there ever remained
between him and our English tongue
a barrier or wall of separation, hard to define,
but easy to perceive. In the true deep sense
he never understood the language. He
studied it, laid regular siege to it, mastered it
to all appearance, yet remained, to the end,
outside of it. His observations, and especially
his unfavorable criticisms, proved this quite
conclusively. Expressions often appeared to
him faulty, in which no English reader would
see anything to remark upon; it may be
added that (by way of compensation) he was
unable to appreciate the oddity of those intentionally
quaint turns of expression which
are invented by the craft of humorists. It
may even be doubted whether his English
was of any ascertainable use to him. He
might probably have come as near to an understanding
of our authors by the help of
translations, and he could not converse in
English, for the spoken language was entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
unintelligible to him. An acquisition of this
kind seems scarcely an adequate reward for
the labor that it costs. Compared with living
Englishmen my French friend was nowhere,
but if English had been a dead language, he
would have been looked up to as a very eminent
scholar, and would have occupied a professor&rsquo;s
chair in the university.</p>

<p>A little more life might be given to the
study of Latin by making it a spoken language.
Boys might be taught to speak Latin
in their schooldays with the modern Roman
pronunciation, which, though probably a
deviation from the ancient, is certainly nearer
to it than our own. If colloquial Latin were
made a subject of special research, it is likely
that a sufficiently rich phrase-book might be
constructed from the plays. If this plan were
pursued throughout Europe (always adopting
the Roman pronunciation) all educated men
would possess a common tongue which might
be enriched to suit modern requirements without
any serious departure from classical construction.
The want of such a system as this
was painfully felt at the council of the Vatican,
where the assembled prelates discovered
that their Latin was of no practical use, although
the Roman Catholic clergy employ
Latin more habitually than any other body
of men in the world. That a modern may be
taught to think in Latin, is proved by the
early education of Montaigne, and I may
mention a much more recent instance. My
brother-in-law told me that, in the spring of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
1871, a friend of his had come to stay with
him accompanied by his little son, a boy
seven years old. This child spoke Latin with
the utmost fluency, and he spoke nothing else.
What I am going to suggest is a Utopian
dream, but let us suppose that a hundred
fathers could be found in Europe, all of this
way of thinking, all resolved to submit to
some inconvenience in order that their sons
might speak Latin as a living language. A
small island might be rented near the coast
of Italy, and in that island Latin alone might
be permitted. Just as the successive governments
of France maintain the establishments
of Sèvres and the Gobelins to keep the manufactures
of porcelain and tapestry up to a
recognized high standard of excellence, so
this Latin island might be maintained to give
more vivacity to scholarship. If there were
but one little corner of ground on the wide
earth where pure Latin was constantly spoken,
our knowledge of the classic writers would
become far more sympathetically intimate.
After living in the Latin island we should
think in Latin as we read, and read without
translating.</p>

<p>But this is dreaming. It is too certain that
on returning from the Latin island into the
atmosphere of modern colleges an evil change
would come over our young Latinists like
that which came upon the young Montaigne
when his father sent him to the college of
Guienne, &ldquo;at that time the best and most
flourishing in France.&rdquo; Montaigne tells us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
that, notwithstanding all his father&rsquo;s precautions,
the place &ldquo;was a college still.&rdquo; &ldquo;My
Latin,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;<i>immediately grew corrupt,
and by discontinuance I have since lost all
manner of use of it.</i>&rdquo; If it were the custom
to speak Latin, it would be the custom to
speak it badly; and a master of the language
would have to conform to the evil
usages around him. Our present state of ignorance
has the charm of being silent, except
when old-fashioned gentlemen in the House
of Commons quote poetry which they cannot
pronounce to hearers who cannot understand
it.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;An English orator quoted from Cicero the sentence
&ldquo;Non intelligunt homines quam magnum vectigal sit parsimonia.&rdquo;
He made the second vowel in <i>vectigal</i> short, and
the House laughed at him; he tried again and pronounced it
with the long sound of the English <i>i</i>, on which the critical
body he addressed was perfectly satisfied. But if a Roman
had been present it is probable that, of the two, the short
English <i>i</i> would have astonished his ears the less, for our
short <i>i</i> does bear some resemblance to the southern <i>i</i>
whereas our long i resembles no single letter in any alphabet
of the Latin family of languages. We are scrupulously careful
to avoid what we call false quantities, we are quite utterly
and ignorantly unscrupulous about false sounds. One of the
best instances is the well-known &ldquo;veni, vidi, vici,&rdquo; which we
pronounce very much as if it had been written <i>vinai</i>, <i>vaidai</i>,
<i>vaisai</i>, in Italian letters.</p></div>

<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>TO A STUDENT OF LITERATURE.</h5>

<p class="pro">Studies, whatever they may be, always considered, by some
a waste of time&mdash;The classical languages&mdash;The higher
mathematics&mdash;The accomplishments&mdash;Indirect uses of
different studies&mdash;Influence of music&mdash;Studies indirectly
useful to authors&mdash;What induced Mr. Roscoe to write the
lives of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici and Leo X.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Whatever</span> you study, some one will consider
that particular study a foolish waste
of time.</p>

<p>If you were to abandon successively every
subject of intellectual labor which had, in its
turn, been condemned by some adviser as useless,
the result would be simple intellectual
nakedness. The classical languages, to begin
with, have long been considered useless by the
majority of practical people&mdash;and pray, what
to shopkeepers, doctors, attorneys, artists,
can be the use of the higher mathematics?
And if these studies, which have been conventionally
classed as serious studies, are considered
unnecessary notwithstanding the tremendous
authority of custom, how much the
more are those studies exposed to a like contempt
which belong to the category of accomplishments!
What is the use of drawing, for
it ends in a worthless sketch? Why should
we study music when after wasting a thousand
hours the amateur cannot satisfy the ear? A
<i>quoi bon</i> modern languages when the accomplishment
only enables us to call a waiter in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
French or German who is sure to answer us
in English? And what, when it is not your
trade, can be the good of dissecting animals
or plants?</p>

<p>To all questionings of this kind there is but
one reply. We work for culture. We work
to enlarge the intelligence, and to make it a
better and more effective instrument. This is
our main purpose; but it may be added that
even for our special labors it is always difficult
to say beforehand exactly what will turn
out in the end to be most useful. What, in
appearance, can be more entirely outside the
work of a landscape painter than the study of
ancient history? and yet I can show you how
an interest in ancient history might indirectly
be of great service to a landscape painter. It
would make him profoundly feel the human
associations of many localities which to an ignorant
man would be devoid of interest or
meaning; and this human interest in the scenes
where great events have taken place, or which
have been distinguished by the habitation of
illustrious men in other ages, is in fact one of
the great fundamental motives of landscape
painting. It has been very much questioned,
especially by foreign critics, whether the interest
in botany which is taken by some of
the more cultivated English landscape painters
is not for them a false direction and
wrong employment of the mind; but a landscape
painter may feel his interest in vegetation
infinitely increased by the accurate
knowledge of its laws, and such an increase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
of interest would make him work more zealously,
and with less danger of weariness and
<i>ennui</i>, besides being a very useful help to the
memory in retaining the authentic vegetable
forms. It may seem more difficult to show
the possible utility of a study apparently so
entirely outside of other studies as music is:
and yet music has an important influence on
the whole of our emotional nature, and indirectly
upon expression of all kinds. He who
has once learned the self-control of the musician,
the use of <i>piano</i> and <i>forte</i>, each in its
right place, when to be lightly swift or majestically
slow, and especially how to keep to the
key once chosen till the right time has come
for changing it; he who has once learned this
knows the secret of the arts. No painter,
writer, orator, who had the power and judgment
of a thoroughly cultivated musician,
could sin against the broad principles of taste.</p>

<p>More than all other men have authors reason
to appreciate the indirect utilities of
knowledge that is apparently irrelevant.
Who can tell what knowledge will be of most
use to <i>them</i>? Even the very greatest of authors
are indebted to miscellaneous reading,
often in several different languages, for the
suggestion of their most original works, and
for the light which has kindled many a shining
thought of their own. And authors who
seem to have less need than others of an outward
help, poets whose compositions might
appear to be chiefly inventive and emotional,
novelists who are free from the restraints and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
the researches of the historian, work up what
they know into what they write; so that if
you could remove every line which is based
on studies outside the strict limits of their art,
you would blot out half their compositions.
Take the antiquarian element out of Scott,
and see how many of his works could never
have been written. Remove from Goldsmith&rsquo;s
brain the recollection of his wayward
studies and strange experiences, and you
would remove the rich material of the &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo;
and the Essays, and mutilate even the
immortal &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield.&rdquo; Without a
classical education and foreign travel, Byron
would not have composed &ldquo;Childe Harold;&rdquo;
without the most catholic interest in the literature
of all the ages, and of many different
peoples from the North Sea to the Mediterranean,
our contemporary William Morris
would never have conceived, and could not
have executed, that strong work &ldquo;The Earthly
Paradise.&rdquo; It may not seem necessary to
learn Italian, yet Mr. Roscoe&rsquo;s celebrity as an
author was due in the first place to his private
fondness for Italian literature. He did not
learn Italian in order that he might write his
biographies, but he wrote about Lorenzo and
Leo because he had mastered Italian, and because
the language led him to take an interest
in the greatest house of Florence. The way
in which authors are led by their favorite
studies indirectly to the great performance of
their lives has never been more clearly illustrated
than in this instance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span> </p>

<p>When William Roscoe was a young man he
had for his friend Francis Holden, nephew of
Mr. Richard Holden, a schoolmaster in Liverpool.
Francis Holden was a young man of uncommon
culture, having at the same time
really sound scholarship in several languages,
and an ardent enthusiasm for literature. He
urged Roscoe to study languages, and used especially,
in their evening walks together, to repeat
to him passages from the noblest poets
of Italy. In this way Roscoe was led to attempt
Italian, and, having once begun, went
on till he had mastered it. &ldquo;It was in the
course of these studies,&rdquo; says his biographer,
&ldquo;that he first formed the idea of writing the
Life of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LETTER V.</h3>

<h5>TO A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WHO REGRETTED
THAT HIS SON HAD THE TENDENCIES OF A DILETTANT.</h5>

<p class="pro">Inaccuracy of the common distinction between amateur pursuits
and more serious studies&mdash;All of us are amateurs in
many things&mdash;Prince Albert&mdash;The Emperor Napoleon III.&mdash;Contrast
between general and professional education&mdash;The
price of high accomplishment.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I agree</span> with you that amateurship, as
generally practised, may be a waste of time,
but the common distinction between amateur
pursuits and serious studies is inconsistent.
A painter whose art is imperfect and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
does not work for money is called an amateur;
a scholar who writes imperfect Latin,
not for money, escapes the imputation of
amateurship, and is called a learned man.
Surely we have been blinded by custom in
these things. Ideas of frivolity are attached
to imperfect acquirement in certain directions,
and ideas of gravity to equally imperfect
acquirement in others. To write bad
Latin poetry is not thought to be frivolous,
but it is considered frivolous to compose imperfectly
and unprofessionally in other fine
arts.</p>

<p>Yet are we not all of us amateurs in those
pursuits which constituted our education&mdash;amateurs
at the best, if we loved them, and
even inferior to amateurs if we disliked them?
We have not sounder knowledge or more
perfect skill in the ancient languages than
Prince Albert had in music. We know something
of them, yet in comparison with perfect
mastery such as that of a cultivated old Greek
or Roman, our scholarship is at the best on a
level with the musical scholarship of a cultivated
amateur like the Prince Consort.</p>

<p>If the essence of dilettantism is to be contented
with imperfect attainment, I fear that
all educated people must be considered dilettants.</p>

<p>It is narrated of the Emperor Napoleon III.
that in answer to some one who inquired of
his Majesty whether the Prince Imperial was
a musician, he replied that he discouraged
dilettantism, and &ldquo;did not wish his son to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
be a Coburg.&rdquo; But the Emperor himself was
quite as much a dilettant as Prince Albert;
though their dilettantism did not lie in the
same directions. The Prince was an amateur
musician and artist; the Emperor was an
amateur historian, an amateur scholar, and
antiquary. It may be added that Napoleon
III. indulged in another and more dangerous
kind of amateurship. He had a taste for
amateur generalship, and the consequences of
his indulgence of this taste are known to
every one.</p>

<p>The variety of modern education encourages
a scattered dilettantism. It is only in
professional life that the energies of young
men are powerfully concentrated. There is
a steadying effect in thorough professional
training which school education does not supply.
Our boys receive praise and prizes for
doing many things most imperfectly, and it
is not their fault if they remain ignorant of
what perfection really is, and of the immensity
of the labor which it costs. I think that
you would do well, perhaps, without discouraging
your son too much by chillingly accurate
estimates of the value of what he has done, to
make him on all proper occasions feel and see
the difference between half-knowledge and
thorough mastery. It would be a good thing
for a youth to be made clearly aware how
enormous a price of labor Nature has set
upon high accomplishment in everything
that is really worthy of his pursuit. It is
this persuasion, which men usually arrive at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
only in their maturity, that operates as the
most effectual tranquillizer of frivolous activities.</p>

<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>

<h5>TO THE PRINCIPAL OF A FRENCH COLLEGE.</h5>

<p class="pro">The Author&rsquo;s dread of protection in intellectual pursuits&mdash;Example
from the Fine Arts&mdash;Prize poems&mdash;Governmental
encouragement of learning&mdash;The bad effects of it&mdash;Pet
pursuits&mdash;Objection to the interference of Ministers&mdash;A
project for separate examinations.</p>

<p><span class="sc">What</span> I am going to say will seem very
strange to you, and is not unlikely to arouse
as much professional animosity as you are capable
of feeling against an old friend. You
who are a dignitary of the University, and
have earned your various titles in a fair field,
as a soldier wins his epaulettes before the enemy,
are not the likeliest person to hear with
patience the unauthorized theories of an innovator.
Take them, then, as mere speculations,
if you will&mdash;not altogether unworthy
of consideration, for they are suggested by a
sincere anxiety for the best interests of learning,
and yet not very dangerous to vested interests
of any kind, since they can have little
influence on the practice or opinion of the
world.</p>

<p>I feel a great dread of what may be called
<i>protection</i> in intellectual pursuits. It seems
to me that when the Government of a country
applies an artificial stimulus to certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
branches of study for their encouragement
by the offer of rewards in honor or in money
beyond the rewards inherent in the studies
themselves, or coming naturally from their
usefulness to mankind, there is a great danger
that men may give a disproportionate attention
to those favored branches of study.
Let me take an example from the practice of
the Fine Arts. A Government, by medals
and crosses, or by money, can easily create
and foster a school of painting which is entirely
out of relation to the century in which
it exists, and quite incapable of working harmoniously
with the contemporary national
life. This has actually been done to a considerable
extent in various countries, especially
in France and in Bavaria. A sort of classicism
which had scarcely any foundation in
sincerity of feeling was kept up artificially by
a system of encouragement which offered inducements
outside the genuine ambition of
an artist. The true enthusiasm which is the
life of art impels the artist to express his own
feeling for the delight of others. The offer of
a medal or a pension induces him to make
the sort of picture which is likely to satisfy
the authorities. He first ascertains what is
according to the rule, and then follows it as
nearly as he is able. He works in a temper of
simple conformity, remote indeed from the
passionate enthusiasm of creation. It is so
with prize poems. We all know the sort of
poetry which is composed in order to gain
prizes. The anxiety of the versifier is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
safe: he tries to compose what will escape
censure; he dreads the originality that may
give offence. But all powerful pictures and
poems have been wrought in the energy of individual
feeling, not in conformity to a pattern.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that, instead of encouraging
poetry or painting, a Government resolves to
encourage learning. It will patronize certain
pursuits to the neglect of others, or it will encourage
certain pursuits more liberally than
others. The subjects of such a Government
will not follow learning exclusively for its delightfulness
or its utility; another consideration
will affect their choice. They will inquire
which pursuits are rewarded by prizes in
honor or money, and they will be strongly
tempted to select them. Therefore, unless the
Government has exercised extraordinary wisdom,
men will learn what they do not really
care for and may never practically want, merely
in order to win some academical grade. So
soon as this object has been attained, they
will immediately abandon the studies by
which they attained it.</p>

<p>Can it be said that in these cases the
purposes of the Government were fulfilled?
Clearly not, if it desired to form a permanent
taste for learning. But it may have done
worse than fail in this merely negative way;
it may have diverted its youth from pursuits
to which Nature called them, and in which
they might have effectually aided the advancement
and the prosperity of the State.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span></p>

<p>Let us suppose that a Government were to
have a pet study, and offer great artificial inducements
for success in it. Suppose that
the pet study were entomology. All the most
promising youth of the country would spend
ten years in emulating Messrs. Kirby and
Spence, and take their degrees as entomological
bachelors. But might it not easily happen
that to a majority of the young gentlemen
this pursuit would have acted positively as a
hindrance by keeping them from other pursuits
more likely to help them in their professions?
It would not only cost a great deal
of valuable time, it would absorb a quantity
of youthful energy which the country can ill
afford to lose. The Government would probably
affirm that entomology, if not always
practically useful in itself, was an invaluable
intellectual training; but what if this training
used up the early vigor which might
be needed for other pursuits, and of which
every human being has only a limited supply?
We should be told, no doubt, that this
powerful encouragement was necessary to
the advancement of science, and it is true
that under such a system the rudiments of
entomology would be more generally known.
But the vulgarization of rudiments is not
the advancement of knowledge. Entomology
has gone quite as far in discovery, though
pursued simply for its own sake, as it would
have gone if it had been made necessary to a
bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</p>

<p>You will ask whether I would go so far as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
to abolish degrees of all kinds, Certainly
not; that is not my project. But I believe
that no Government is competent to make a
selection amongst intellectual pursuits and
say, &ldquo;This or that pursuit shall be encouraged
by university degrees, whilst other pursuits
of intellectual men shall have no encouragement
whatever.&rdquo; I may mention by
name your present autocrat of Public Instruction,
Jules Simon. He is a literary man
of some eminence; he has written several interesting
books, and on the whole he is probably
more competent to deal with these questions
than many of his predecessors. But
however capable a man may be, he is sure to
be biassed by the feeling common to all intellectual
men which attributes a peculiar importance
to their own pursuits. I do not like
to see any Minister, or any Cabinet of Ministers,
settling what all the young men of a
country are to learn under penalty of exclusion
from all the liberal professions.</p>

<p>What I should think more reasonable would
be some such arrangement as the following.
There might be a board of thoroughly competent
examiners for each branch of study separately,
authorized to confer certificates of competence.
When a man believed himself to have
mastered a branch of study, he would go and
try to get a certificate for that. The various
studies would then be followed according to the
public sense of their importance, and would
fall quite naturally into the rank which they
ought to occupy at any given period of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
national history. These separate examinations
should be severe enough to ensure a serviceable
degree of proficiency. Nobody should
be allowed to teach anything who had not got a
certificate for the particular thing he intended
to profess. In the confusion of your present
system, not only do you fail to insure the
thoroughness of pupils, but the teachers themselves
are too frequently incompetent in some
speciality which accidentally fails to their
share. I think that a Greek master ought to
be a complete Hellenist, but surely it is not
necessary that he should be half a mathematician.</p>

<p>To sum up. It seems to me that a Government
has no business to favor some intellectual
pursuits more than others, but that it
ought to recognize competent attainment in
every one of them by a sort of diploma or certificate,
leaving the relative rank of different
pursuits to be settled by public opinion. And
as to the educators themselves, I think that
when a man has proved his competence in
one thing, he ought to be allowed to teach
that one thing in the University without being
required to pass an examination in any
other thing.</p>

<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>

<h5>TO THE PRINCIPAL OF A FRENCH COLLEGE.</h5>

<p class="pro">Loss of time to acquire an ancient language too imperfectly
for it to be useful&mdash;Dr. Arnold&mdash;Mature life leaves little
time for culture&mdash;Modern indifference to ancient thinking&mdash;Larger
experience of the moderns&mdash;The moderns
older than the ancients&mdash;The Author&rsquo;s regret that Latin
has ceased to be a living language&mdash;The shortest way to
learn to read a language&mdash;The recent interest in modern
languages&mdash;A French student of Hebrew.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I was</span> happy to learn your opinion of the reform
so recently introduced by the Minister of
Public Instruction, and the more so that I was
glad to find the views of so inexperienced a
person as myself confirmed by your wider
knowledge. You went even farther than M.
Jules Simon, for you openly expressed a desire
for the complete withdrawal of Greek
from the ordinary school curriculum. Not
that you undervalue Greek,&mdash;no one of your
scholarship would be likely to undervalue a
great literature,&mdash;but you thought it a loss of
time to acquire a language so imperfectly that
the literature still remained practically closed
whilst thousands of valuable hours had been
wasted on the details of grammar. The truth
is, that although the principle of beginning
many things in school education with the idea
that the pupil will in maturer life pursue them
to fuller accomplishment may in some instances
be justified by the prolonged studies
of men who have a natural taste for erudition,
it is idle to shut one&rsquo;s eyes to the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
most men have no inclination for school-work
after they have left school, and if they had
the inclination they have not the time. Our
own Dr. Arnold, the model English schoolmaster,
said, &ldquo;It is so hard to begin anything in
after-life, and so comparatively easy to continue
what has been begun, that I think we
are bound to break ground, as it were, into
several of the mines of knowledge with our pupils;
that the first difficulties may be overcome
by them whilst there is yet a power from without
to aid their own faltering resolution, and
that so they may be enabled, if they will, to
go on with the study hereafter.&rdquo; The principle
here expressed is no doubt one of the important
principles of all early education, and
yet I think that it cannot be safely followed
without taking account of human nature,
such as it is. Everything hangs on that little
parenthesis &ldquo;if they will.&rdquo; And if they
will <i>not</i>, how then? The time spent in breaking
the ground has been wasted, except so far
as the exercise of breaking the ground may
have been useful in mental gymnastics.</p>

<p>Mature life brings so many professional or
social duties that it leaves scant time for culture;
and those who care for culture most
earnestly and sincerely, are the very persons
who will economize time to the utmost. Now,
to read a language that has been very imperfectly
mastered is felt to be a bad economy of
time. Suppose the case of a man occupied in
business who has studied Greek rather assiduously
in youth and yet not enough to read it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
with facility. Suppose that this man wants to
get at the mind of Plato. He can read the original,
but he reads it so slowly that it would
cost him more hours than he can spare, and
this is why he has recourse to a translation.
In this case there is no indifference to Greek
culture; on the contrary, the reader desires
to assimilate what he can of it, but the very
earnestness of his wish to have free access to
ancient thought makes him prefer it in modern
language.</p>

<p>This is the most favorable instance that can
be imagined, except, of course, those exceedingly
rare cases where a man has leisure
enough, and enthusiasm enough, to become a
Hellenist. The great majority of our contemporaries
do not care for ancient thought
at all, it is so remote from them, it belongs to
conditions of civilization so different from
their own, it is encumbered with so many
lengthy discussions of questions which have
been settled by the subsequent experience of
the world, that the modern mind prefers to
occupy itself with its own anxieties and its
own speculations. It is a great error to suppose
that indifference to ancient thinking is
peculiar to the spirit of Philistinism; for the
most cultivated contemporary intellects seek
light from each other rather than from the
ancients. One of the most distinguished of
modern thinkers, a scholar of the rarest classical
attainments, said to me in reference to
some scheme of mine for renewing my classical
studies, that they would be of no more use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
to me than numismatics. It is this feeling, the
feeling that Greek speculation is of less consequence
to the modern world than German and
French speculation, which causes so many of
us, rightly or wrongly, to regard it as a palæontological
curiosity, interesting for those who
are curious as to the past of the human mind,
but not likely to be influential upon its future.</p>

<p>This estimate of ancient thinking is not often
expressed quite so openly as I have just
expressed it, and yet it is very generally prevalent
even amongst the most thoughtful people,
especially if modern science has had any
conspicuous influence in the formation of
their minds. Tho truth is, as Sydney Smith
observed many years ago, that there is a confusion
of language in the use of the word &ldquo;ancient.&rdquo;
We say &ldquo;the ancients,&rdquo; as if they
were older and more experienced men than
we are, whereas the age and experience are
entirely on our side. They were the clever
children, &ldquo;and we only are the white-bearded,
silver-headed ancients, who have treasured
up, and are prepared to profit by, all the experience
which human life can supply.&rdquo; The
sense of our larger experience, as it grows in
us and becomes more distinctly conscious,
produces a corresponding decline in our feelings
of reverence for classic times. The past
has bequeathed to us its results, and we have
incorporated them into our own edifice, but
we have used them rather as materials than
as models.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span> </p>

<p>In your practical desire to retain in education
only what is likely to be used, you are
willing to preserve Latin. M. Jules Simon
says that Latin ought to be studied only to be
read. On this point permit me to offer an
observation. The one thing I regret about
Latin is that we have ceased to speak it. The
natural method, and by far the most rapid
and sure method of learning a language, is to
begin by acquiring words in order to use
them to ask for what we want; after that we
acquire other words for narration and the expression
of our sentiments. By far the shortest
way to learn to read a language is to begin
by speaking it. The colloquial tongue is
the basis of the literary tongue. This is so
true that with all the pains and trouble you
give to the Latin education of your pupils,
you cannot teach them as much Latin, for
reading only, in the course of ten years, as a
living foreigner will give them of his own
language in ten months. I seriously believe
that if your object is to make boys read Latin
easily, you begin at the wrong end. It is deplorable
that the learned should ever have
allowed Latin to become a dead language,
since in permitting this they have enormously
increased the difficulty of acquiring it, even
for the purposes of scholarship.</p>

<p>No foreigner who knows the French people
will disapprove of the novel desire to know
the modern languages, which has been one
of the most unexpected consequences of the
war. Their extreme ignorance of the literature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
of other nations has been the cause of
enormous evils. Notwithstanding her central
position, France has been a very isolated
country intellectually, much more isolated
than England, more isolated even than
Transylvania, where foreign literatures are familiar
to the cultivated classes. This isolation
has produced very lamentable effects,
not only on the national culture but most
especially on the national character. No modern
nation, however important, can safely remain
in ignorance of its contemporaries.
The Frenchman was like a gentleman shut up
within his own park-wall, having no intercourse
with his neighbors, and reading nothing
but the history of his own ancestors&mdash;for
the Romans were your ancestors, intellectually.
It is only by the study of living languages,
and their continual use, that we can
learn our true place in the world. A Frenchman
was studying Hebrew; I ventured to
suggest that German might possibly be more
useful. To this he answered, <i>that there was
no literature in German</i>. &ldquo;<i>Vous avez Goethe,
vous avez Schiller, et vous avez Lessing, mais
en dehors de ces trois noms il n&rsquo;y a rien.</i>&rdquo; This
meant simply that my student of Hebrew
measured German literature by his own
knowledge of it. Three names had reached
him, only names, and only three of them.
As to the men who were unknown to him he
had decided that they did not exist. Certainly
if there are many Frenchmen in this condition,
it is time that they learned a little German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span></p>
<h3>LETTER VIII.</h3>

<h5>TO A STUDENT OF MODERN LANGUAGES.</h5>

<p class="pro">Standard of attainment in living languages higher than in
ancient ones&mdash;Difficulty of maintaining high pretensions&mdash;Prevalent
illusion about the facility of modern languages&mdash;Easy
to speak them badly&mdash;Some propositions
based upon experience&mdash;Expectations and disappointments.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Had</span> your main purpose in the education
of yourself (I do not say self-education, for
you wisely accept all help from others) been
the attainment of classical scholarship, I
might have observed that as the received
standard in that kind of learning is not a very
elevated one, you might reasonably hope to
reach it with a certain calculable quantity of
effort. The classical student has only to contend
against other students who are and have
been situated very much as he is situated himself.
They have learned Latin and Greek
from grammars and dictionaries as he is learning
them, and the only natural advantages
which any of his predecessors may have possessed
are superiorities of memory which may
be compensated by his greater perseverance,
or superiorities of sympathy to which he
may &ldquo;level up&rdquo; by that acquired and artificial
interest which comes from protracted
application. But the student of modern languages
has to contend against advantages of
situation, as the gardeners of an inhospitable
climate contend against the natural sunshine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
of the south. How easy it is to have a fruitful
date-tree in Arabia, how difficult in England!
How easy for the Florentine to speak
Italian, how difficult for us! The modern
linguist can never fence himself behind that
stately unquestionableness which shields the
classical scholar. His knowledge may at any
time be put to the severest of all tests, to a
test incomparably more severe than the strictest
university examination. The first <i>native</i>
that he meets is his examiner, the first foreign
city is his Oxford. And this is probably
one reason why accomplishment in modern
languages has been rather a matter of utility
than of dignity, for it is difficult to keep up
great pretensions in the face of a multitude
of critics. What would the most learned-looking
gown avail, if a malicious foreigner
were laughing at us?</p>

<p>But there is a deep satisfaction in the severity
of the test. An honest and courageous
student likes to be clearly aware of the exact
value of his acquisitions. He takes his French
to Paris and has it tested there as we take our
plate to the silversmith, and after that he
knows, or may know, quite accurately what
it is worth. He has not the dignity of scholarship,
he is not held to be a learned man, but
he has acquired something which may be of
daily use to him in society, or in commerce,
or in literature; and there are thousands of
educated natives who can accurately estimate
his attainment and help him to a higher perfection.
All this is deeply satisfying to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>
lover of intellectual realities. The modern
linguist is always on firm ground, and in
broad daylight. He may impede his own
progress by the illusions of solitary self-conceit,
but the atmosphere outside is not favorable
to such illusions. It is well for him
that the temptations to charlatanism are so
few, that the risks of exposure are so frequent.</p>

<p>Still there <i>are</i> illusions, and the commonest
of them is that a modern language may be
very easily mastered. There is a popular
idea that French is easy, that Italian is easy,
that German is more difficult, yet by no
means insuperably difficult. It is believed
that when an Englishman has spent all the
best years of his youth in attempting to learn
Latin and Greek, he may acquire one or two
modern languages with little effort during a
brief residence on the Continent. It is certainly
true that we may learn any number of
foreign languages so as to speak them badly,
but it surely cannot be easy to speak them
well. It may be inferred that this is not easy
because the accomplishment is so rare. The
inducements are common, the accomplishment
is rare. Thousands of English people
have very strong reasons for learning French,
thousands of French people could improve
their position by learning English; but rare
indeed are the men and women who know
both languages thoroughly.</p>

<p>The following propositions, based on much
observation of a kind wholly unprejudiced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
and tested by a not inconsiderable experience
will be found, I believe, unassailable.</p>

<p>1. <i>Whenever a foreign language is perfectly
acquired there are peculiar family conditions.
The person has either married a person of the
other nation, or is of mixed blood.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>When a foreign language has been acquired
(there are instances of this) in quite
absolute perfection, there is almost always
some loss in the native tongue.  Either the
native tongue is not spoken correctly, or it is
not spoken with perfect ease.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>A man sometimes speaks two languages
correctly, his father&rsquo;s and his mother&rsquo;s, or
his own and his wife&rsquo;s, but never three.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>Children can speak several languages exactly
like natives, but in succession, never
simultaneously. They forget the first in acquiring
the second, and so on.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>A language cannot be learned by an
adult without five years&rsquo; residence in the
country where it is spoken, and without habits
of close observation a residence of twenty
years is insufficient.</i></p>

<p>This is not encouraging, but it is the truth.
Happily, a knowledge which falls far short of
mastery may be of much practical use in the
common affairs of life, and may even afford
some initiation into foreign literatures. I do
not argue that because perfection is denied of
us by the circumstances of our lives or the
necessities of our organization we are therefore
to abandon the study to every language
but the mother tongue. It may be of use to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
us to know several languages imperfectly, if
only we confess the hopelessness of absolute
attainment. That which is truly, and deeply,
and seriously an injury to our intellectual
life, is the foolishness of the <span class="correction" title="amended from two">too</span> common
vanity which first deludes itself with childish
expectations and then tortures itself with
late regret for failure which might have been
easily foreseen.</p>

<p><span class="sc">My</span> five propositions about learning modern
languages appear from your answer to have
rather surprised you, and you ask for some
instances in illustration. I am aware that
my last letter was dogmatic, so let me begin
by begging your pardon for its dogmatism.
The present communication may steer clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
of that rock of offence, for it shall confine
itself to an account of cases that I have
known.</p>

<p>One of the most accomplished of English
linguists remarked to me that after much
observation of the labors of others, and a fair
estimate of his own, he had come to the
rather discouraging conclusion that it was
not possible to learn a foreign language. He
did not take account of the one exceptional
class of cases where the family conditions
make the use of two languages habitual. The
most favorable family conditions are not in
themselves sufficient to <i>ensure</i> the acquisition
of a language, but wherever an instance
of perfect acquisition is to be found, these
family conditions are always found along
with it. My friend W., an English artist
living in Paris, speaks French with quite absolute
accuracy as to grammar and choice of
expression, and with accuracy of pronunciation
so nearly absolute that the best French
ears can detect nothing wrong but the pronunciation
of the letter &ldquo;<i>r</i>.&rdquo; He has lived
in France for the space of forty years, but it
may be doubted whether in forty years he
could have mastered the language as he has
done if he had not married a native. French
has been his home language for 30 years and
more, and the perfect ease and naturalness
of his diction are due to the powerful home
influences, especially to the influence of children.
A child is born that speaks the foreign
tongue from the first inarticulate beginnings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
It makes its own child language, and the
father as he hears it is born over again in the
foreign land by tender paternal sympathy.
Gradually the sweet child-talk gives place to
the perfect tongue and the father follows it
by insensible gradations, himself the most
docile of pupils, led onward rather than instructed
by the winning and playful little
master, incomparably the best of masters.
The process here is nature&rsquo;s own inimitable
process. Every new child that is born to a
man so situated carries him through a repetition
of that marvellous course of teaching.
The language <i>grows</i> in his brain from the first
rudiments&mdash;the real natural rudiments, not
the hard rudiments of the grammarian&mdash;just
as plants grow naturally from their seeds.
It has not been built by human processes of
piecing together, but has developed itself like
a living creature. This way of learning a
language possesses over the dictionary process
exactly the kind of superiority which a
living man, developed naturally from the
foetus, possesses over the elastic anatomical
man-model of the ingenious doctor Auzoux.
The doctor&rsquo;s models are remarkably perfect
in construction, they have all the organs, but
they have not life.</p>

<p>When, however, this natural process of
growth is allowed to go forward without
watchful care, it is likely to displace the
mother tongue. It is sometimes affirmed
that the impressions of childhood are never
effaced, that the mother tongue is <i>never</i> forgotten.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
It may be that it is never wholly
forgotten, except in the case of young children,
but it may become so imperfect as to be
practically of little use. I knew an Italian
who came to France as a young man and
learned his profession there. He was afterwards
naturalized, married a French lady,
had several children, pursued a very successful
career in Paris, and became ultimately
French Ambassador at the court of Victor
Emmanuel. His French was so perfect that
it was quite impossible for any one to detect
the usual Italian accents. I used to count
him as a remarkable and almost solitary instance
of a man speaking two languages in
their perfection, but I learned since then that
his French had displaced his Italian, and so
completely that he was quite unable to speak
Italian correctly, and made use of French invariably
when in Italy. The risk of this displacement
is always greatest in cases where
the native tongue is not kept up by means of
literature. Byron and Shelley, or our contemporary
Charles Lever, would run little risk of
losing English by continental residence, but
people not accustomed to reading and writing
often forget the mother tongue in a few years,
even when the foreign one which has displaced
it is still in a state of imperfection.
Madame L. is an English lady who married a
Frenchman; neither her husband nor her
children speak English, and as her relatives
live in one of our most distant colonies, she
has been separated from them for many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
years. Isolated thus from English society,
living in a part of France rarely visited by
her countrymen, never reading English, and
writing it little and at long intervals, she
speaks it now with much difficulty and diffidence.
Her French is not grammatical, though
she has lived for many years with people who
speak grammatically; but then her French is
fluent and alive, truly her own living language
now, whilst English is, if not wholly
forgotten, dead almost as our Latin is dead.
She and I always speak French together when
we meet, because it is easier for her than
English, and a more natural expression. I
have known some other cases of displacement
of the native tongue, and have lately
had the opportunity of watching a case of
such displacement during its progress. A
sergeant in the Italian army deserted to join
Garibaldi in the campaign of 1870. On the
conclusion of peace it was impossible for him
to return to Italy, so he settled in France and
married there. I found some work for him,
and for some months saw him frequently.
Up to the date of his marriage he spoke no
language but Italian, which he could read
and write correctly, but after his marriage
the process of displacement of the native
tongue began immediately by the corruption
of it. He did not keep his Italian safely by
itself, putting the French in a place of its own
as he gradually acquired it, but he mixed the
two inextricably together. Imagine the case
of a man who, having a bottle half full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
wine, gets some beer given him and pours it
immediately into the wine-bottle. The beer
will never be pure beer, but it will effectually
spoil the wine. This process is not so much
one of displacement as of corruption, it
takes place readily in uncultivated minds,
with feeble separating powers. Another example
of this was a Neapolitan servant of an
English gentleman, who mixed his Italian
twice, first with French and afterwards with
English, producing a compound intelligible to
nobody but himself, if indeed he himself understood
it. At the time I knew him, the
man had no means of communication with
his species. When his master told him to do
anything, he made a guess at what was likely
to be for the moment his master&rsquo;s most probable
want, and sometimes hit the mark, but
more generally missed it. The man&rsquo;s name
was Alberino, and I remember on one occasion
profiting by a mistaken guess of his.
After a visit to Alberino&rsquo;s master, my servant
brought forth a magnificent basket of trout,
which surprised me, as nothing had been said
about them. However, we ate them, and
only discovered afterwards that the present
was due to an illusion of Alberino&rsquo;s. His
master had never told him to give me the
trout, but he had interpreted some other order
in that sense. When you asked him for
mustard, he would first touch the salt, and
then the pepper, etc., looking at you inquiringly
till you nodded assent. Any attempt at
conversation with Alberino was sure to lead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
to a perfect comedy of misunderstandings.
He never had the remotest idea of what his
interlocutor was talking about; but he pretended
to catch your meaning, and answered
at haphazard. He had a habit of talking
aloud to himself, &ldquo;but in a tongue no man
could understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a law that cultivated people can keep
languages apart, and in their purity, better
than persons who have not habits of intellectual
analysis. When I lived in Scotland three
languages were spoken in my house all day
long, and a housemaid came to us from the
Lowlands who spoke nothing but Lowland
Scotch. She used to ask what was the French
for this thing or that, and then what was the
Gaelic for it. Having been answered, she invariably
asked the farther question which of
the three words, French, Gaelic, or English,
<i>was the right word</i>. She remained, to the
last, entirely incapable of conceiving how all
the three could be right. Had she learned another
language, it must have been by substitution
for her own. This is exactly the natural
process which takes place in the brains of
children who are transferred from one country
to another. My eldest boy spoke English
in childhood as well as any other English
child of his age. He was taken to the south
of France, and in three months he replaced
his English with Provençal, which he learned
from the servants about him. There were
two ladies in the house who spoke English
well, and did all in their power, in compliance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
with my urgent entreaties, to preserve the
boy&rsquo;s native language; but the substitution
took place too rapidly, and was beyond control.
He began by an unwillingness to use
English words whenever he could use Provençal
instead, and in a remarkably short
time this unwillingness was succeeded by inability.
The native language was as completely
taken out of his brain as a violin is
taken out of its case: nothing remained, <i>nothing</i>,
not one word, not any echo of an accent.
And as a violinist may put a new instrument
into the case from which he has removed the
old one, so the new language occupied the
whole space which had been occupied by English.
When I saw the child again, there was
no means of communication between us.</p>

<p>After that, he was removed to the north of
France, and the same process began again.
As Provençal had pushed out English, so
French began to push out Provençal. The
process was wonderfully rapid. The child
heard people speak French, and he began to
speak French like them without any formal
teaching. He spoke the language as he
breathed the air. In a few weeks he did not
retain the least remnant of his Provençal; it
was gone after his English into the limbo of
the utterly forgotten.</p>

<p>Novelists have occasionally made use of
cases similar to this, but they speak of the
forgotten language as being forgotten in the
manner that Scott forgot the manuscript of
&ldquo;Waverley,&rdquo; which he found afterwards in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
the drawers of an old writing-desk when he
was seeking for fishing-tackle. They assume
(conveniently for the purposes of their art)
that the first language we learn is never really
lost, but may be as it were under certain circumstances
<i>mislaid</i>, to be found again at some
future period. Now, although something of
this kind may be possible when the first language
has been spoken in rather advanced
boyhood, I am convinced that in childhood
a considerable number of languages might
succeed each other without leaving any trace
whatever. I might have remarked that in
addition to English, Provençal, and French,
my boy had understood Gaelic in his infancy,
at least to some extent, though he did not
speak it. The languages in his case succeeded
each other without any cost of effort, and
without any appreciable effect on health. The
pronunciation of each language was quite
faultless so far as foreign accent went; the
child had the defects of children, but of children
born in the different countries where he
<span class="correction" title="amended from live">lived</span>.</p>

<p>As we grow older this facility of acquisition
gradually leaves us. M. Philarète Chasles
says that it is quite impossible for any adult
to learn German: an adult may learn German
as Dr. Arnold did for purposes of erudition,
for which it is enough to know a language as
we know Latin, but this is not mastery. You
have met with many foreign residents in England,
who after staying in the country for
many years can barely make themselves intelligible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
and must certainly be incapable of
appreciating those beauties of our literature
which are dependent upon arrangements of
sound. The resisting power of the adult brain
is quite as remarkable as the assimilating power
of the immature brain. A child hears a sound,
and repeats it with perfect accuracy; a man
hears a sound, and by way of imitation utters
something altogether different, being nevertheless
persuaded that it is at least a close and
satisfactory approximation. Children imitate
well, but adults badly, and the acquisition of
languages depends mainly on imitation. The
resisting power of adults is often seen very
remarkably in international marriages. In
those classes of society where there is not
much culture, or leisure or disposition for culture,
the one will not learn the other&rsquo;s language
from opportunity or from affection,
but only under absolute necessity. It seems
as if two people living always together would
gain each other&rsquo;s languages as a matter of
course, but the fact is that they do not.
French people who marry foreigners do not
usually acquire the foreign language if the
pair remain in France; English people under
similar conditions make the attempt more
frequently, but they rest contented with imperfect
attainment.</p>

<p>If the power of resistance is so great in
people who being wedded together for life
have peculiarly strong inducements for learning
each other&rsquo;s languages, it need surprise
us little to find a like power of resistance in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
cases where motives of affection are altogether
absent. Englishmen who go to France
as adults, and settle there, frequently remain
for many years in a state of half-knowledge
which, though it may carry them through
the little difficulties of life at railway stations
and restaurants, is for any intellectual purpose
of no conceivable utility. I knew a retired
English officer, a bachelor, who for
many years had lived in Paris without any
intention of returning to England. His
French just barely carried him through the
small transactions of his daily life, but was
so limited and so incorrect that he could
not maintain a conversation. His vocabulary
was very meagre; his genders were all wrong,
and he did not know one single verb, literally
not one. His pronunciation was so foreign as
to be very nearly unintelligible, and he hesitated
so much that it was painful to have to
listen to him. I could mention a celebrated
German, who has lived in or near Paris for
the last twenty years, and who can neither
speak nor write the language with any approach
to accuracy. Another German, who
settled in France as a master of languages,
wrote French tolerably, but spoke it <i>in</i>tolerably.
There are Germans in London, who
have lived there long enough to have families
and make fortunes, yet who continue to repeat
the ordinary German faults of pronunciation,
the same faults which they committed
years ago, when first they landed on our
shores.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span></p>

<p>The child hears and repeats the true sound,
the adult misleads himself by the spelling.
Seldom indeed can the adult recover the innocence
of the ear. It is like the innocence of
the eye, which has to be recovered before we
can paint from nature, and which belongs
only to infancy and to art.</p>

<p>Let me observe, in conclusion, that although
to know a foreign language perfectly
is a most valuable aid to the intellectual life, I
have never known an instance of very imperfect
attainment which seemed to enrich the
student intellectually. Until you can really
feel the refinements of a language, your mental
culture can get little help or furtherance
from it of any kind, nothing but an interminable
series of misunderstandings. I think
that in the education of our boys too many
languages are attempted, and that their minds
would profit more by the perfect acquisition
of a single language in addition to the native
tongue. This, of course, is looking at the
matter simply from the intellectual point of
view. There may be practical reasons for
knowing several languages imperfectly. It
may be of use to many men in commercial
situations to know a little of several languages,
even a few words and phrases are
valuable to a traveller, but all intellectual labor
of the higher kind requires much more
than that. It is of use to society that there
should be polyglot waiters who can tell us
when the train starts in four or five languages;
but the polyglot waiters themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
are not intellectually advanced by their accomplishment;
for, after all, the facts of the
railway time-table are always the same small
facts, in however many languages they
may be announced. True culture ought to
strengthen the faculty of thinking, and to
provide the material upon which that noble
faculty may operate. An accomplishment
which does neither of these two things for us
is useless for our culture, though it may be of
considerable practical convenience in the affairs
of ordinary life. It is right to add, however,
that there is sometimes an <i>indirect</i> intellectual
benefit from such accomplishments.
To be able to order dinner in Spanish is not
in itself an intellectual advantage; but if the
dinner, when you have eaten it, enables you
to visit a cathedral whose architecture you
are qualified to appreciate, there is a clear intellectual
gain, though an indirect one.</p>

<h3>LETTER X.</h3>

<h5>TO A STUDENT WHO LAMENTED HIS DEFECTIVE
MEMORY.</h5>

<p class="pro">The author rather inclined to congratulation than to condolence&mdash;Value
of a selecting memory&mdash;Studies of the young
Goethe&mdash;His great faculty of assimilation&mdash;A good literary
memory like a well-edited periodical&mdash;The selecting
memory in art&mdash;Treacherous memories&mdash;Cures suggested
for them&mdash;The mnemotechnic art contrary to the true discipline
of the mind&mdash;Two instances&mdash;The memory safely
aided only by right association.</p>

<p><span class="sc">So</span> far from writing, as you seem to expect
me to do, a letter of condolence on the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
of what you are pleased to call your &ldquo;miserable
memory,&rdquo; I feel disposed rather to indite
a letter of congratulation. It is possible that
you may be blessed with a selecting memory,
which is not only useful for what it retains but
for what it rejects. In the immense mass of
facts which come before you in literature and
in life, it is well that you should suffer from
as little bewilderment as possible. The nature
of your memory saves you from this by
unconsciously selecting what has interested
you, and letting the rest go by. What interests
you is what concerns you.</p>

<p>In saying this I speak simply from the intellectual
point of view, and suppose you to
be an intellectual man by the natural organization
of your brain, to begin with. In saying
that what interests you is what concerns you,
I mean intellectually, not materially. It may
concern you, in the pecuniary sense, to take
an interest in the law; yet your mind, left to
itself, would take little or no interest in law,
but an absorbing interest in botany. The
passionate studies of the young Goethe, in
many different directions, always in obedience
to the predominant interests of the moment,
are the best example of the way in
which a great intellect, with remarkable powers
of acquisition and liberty to grow in free
luxuriance, sends its roots into various soils
and draws from them the constituents of its
sap. As a student of law, as a university
student even, he was not of the type which
parents and professors consider satisfactory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
He neglected jurisprudence, he neglected even
his college studies, but took an interest in so
many other pursuits that his mind became
rich indeed. Yet the wealth which his mind
acquired seems to have been due to that liberty
of ranging by which it was permitted to
him to seek his own everywhere, according to
the maxim of French law, <i>chacun prend son
bien où il le trouve</i>. Had he been a poor student,
bound down to the exclusively legal studies,
which did not greatly interest him, it is
likely that no one would ever have suspected
his immense faculty of assimilation. In this
way men who are set by others to load their
memories with what is not their proper intellectual
food, never get the credit of having
any memory at all, and end by themselves believing
that they have none. These bad
memories are often the best, they are often
the selecting memories. They seldom win distinction
in examinations, but in literature
and art. They are quite incomparably superior
to the miscellaneous memories that receive
only as boxes and drawers receive what
is put into them. A good literary or artistic
memory is not like a post-office that takes in
everything, but like a very well-edited periodical
which prints nothing that does not harmonize
with its intellectual life. A well-known
author gave me this piece of advice:
&ldquo;Take as many notes as you like, but when
you write do not look at them&mdash;what you remember
is what you must write, and you
ought to give things exactly the degree of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
relative importance that they have in your
memory. If you forget much, it is well, it
will only save beforehand the labor of erasure.&rdquo;
This advice would not be suitable to
every author; an author who dealt much in
minute facts ought to be allowed to refer to
his memoranda; but from the artistic point
of view in literature the advice was wise indeed.
In painting, our preferences select
whilst we are in the presence of nature, and
our memory selects when we are away from
nature. The most beautiful compositions are
produced by the selecting office of the memory,
which retains some features, and even
greatly exaggerates them, whilst it diminishes
others and often altogether omits them.
An artist who blamed himself for these exaggerations
and omissions would blame himself
for being an artist.</p>

<p>Let me add a protest against the common
methods of curing what are called treacherous
memories. They are generally founded upon
the association of ideas, which is so far rational,
but then the sort of association which
they have recourse to is unnatural, and produces
precisely the sort of disorder which
would be produced in dress if a man were insane
enough to tie, let us say, a frying-pan to
one of his coat-tails and a child&rsquo;s kite to the
other. The true discipline of the mind is to
be effected only by associating those things together
which have a real relation of some
kind, and the profounder the relation, the
more it is based upon the natural constitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
of things, and the less it concerns trifling external
details, the better will be the order of
the intellect. The mnemotechnic art wholly
disregards this, and is therefore unsuited for
intellectual persons, though it may be of some
practical use in ordinary life. A little book
on memory, of which many editions have
been sold, suggests to men who forget their
umbrellas that they ought always to associate
the image of an umbrella with that of an open
door, so that they could never leave any
house without thinking of one. But would it
not be preferable to lose two or three guineas
annually rather than see a spectral umbrella
in every doorway? The same writer suggests
an idea which appears even more objectionable.
Because we are apt to lose time, we
ought, he says, to imagine a skeleton clock-face
on the visage of every man we talk with;
that is to say, we ought systematically to set
about producing in our brains an absurd association
of ideas, which is quite closely allied
to one of the most common forms of insanity.
It is better to forget umbrellas and lose hours
than fill our minds with associations of a kind
which every disciplined intellect does all it
can to get rid of. The rational art of memory
is that used in natural science. We remember
anatomy and botany because, although
the facts they teach are infinitely numerous,
they are arranged according to the constructive
order of nature. Unless there were a
clear relation between the anatomy of one animal
and that of others, the memory would refuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
to burden itself with the details of their
structure. So in the study of languages
we learn several languages by perceiving
their true structural relations, and remembering
these. Association of this kind, and the
maintenance of order in the mind, are the
only arts of memory compatible with the
right government of the intellect. Incongruous,
and even superficial associations ought to
be systematically discouraged, and we ought
to value the negative or rejecting power of
the memory. The finest intellects are as remarkable
for the ease with which they resist
and throw off what does not concern them as
for the permanence with which their own
truths engrave themselves. They are like
clear glass, which fluoric acid etches indelibly,
but which comes out of vitriol intact.</p>

<h3>LETTER XI.</h3>

<h5>TO A MASTER OF ARTS WHO SAID THAT A CERTAIN
DISTINGUISHED PAINTER WAS HALF-EDUCATED.</h5>

<p class="pro">Conventional idea about the completeness of education&mdash;The
estimate of a schoolmaster&mdash;No one can be fully educated&mdash;Even
Leonardo da Vinci fell short of the complete expression
of his faculties&mdash;The word &ldquo;education&rdquo; used in
two different senses&mdash;The acquisition of knowledge&mdash;Who
are the learned?&mdash;Quotation from Sydney Smith&mdash;What
a &ldquo;half-educated&rdquo; painter had learned&mdash;What faculties
he had developed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">An</span> intelligent lady was lamenting to me
the other day that when she heard anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
she did not quite agree with, it only set her
thinking, and did not suggest any immediate
reply. &ldquo;Three hours afterwards,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;I arrive at the answer which ought to have
been given, but then it is exactly three hours
too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being afflicted with precisely the same pitiable
infirmity, I said nothing in reply to a
statement you made yesterday evening at
dinner, but it occupied me in the hansom as
it rolled between the monotonous lines of
houses, and followed me even into my bed-room.
I should like to answer it this morning,
as one answers a letter.</p>

<p>You said that our friend the painter was
&ldquo;half-educated.&rdquo; This made me try to understand
what it is to be three-quarters educated,
and seven-eighths educated, and finally
what must be that quite perfect state of the
man who is whole-educated.</p>

<p>I fear that you must have adopted some
conventional idea about completeness of education,
since you believe that there is any
such thing as completeness, and that education
can be measured by fractions, like the
divisions of a two-foot rule.</p>

<p>Is not such an idea just a little arbitrary?
It seems to be the idea of a schoolmaster,
with his little list of subjects and his professional
habit of estimating the progress of his
boys by the good marks they are likely to obtain
from their examiners. The half-educated
schoolboy would be a schoolboy half-way
towards his bachelor&rsquo;s degree&mdash;is that it?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span> </p>

<p>In the estimates of school and college this
may be so, and it may be well to keep up the
illusion, during boyhood, that there is such a
thing attainable as the complete education
that you assume. But the wider experience
of manhood tends rather to convince us that
no one can be fully educated, and that the
more rich and various the natural talents,
the greater will be the difficulty of educating
the whole of them. Indeed it does not appear
that in a state of society so advanced in
the different specialities as ours is, men were
ever intended to do more than develop by education
a few of their natural gifts. The only
man who came near to a complete education
was Leonardo da Vinci, but such a personage
would be impossible to-day. No contemporary
Leonardo could be at the same time a
leader in fine art, a great military and civil
engineer, and a discoverer in theoretical
science; the specialists have gone too far for
him. Born in our day, Leonardo would have
been either a specialist or an amateur. Situated
even as he was, in a time and country
so remarkably favorable to the general development
of a variously gifted man, he still fell
short of the complete expansion of all his extraordinary
faculties. He was a great artist,
and yet his artistic power was never developed
beyond the point of elaborately careful
labor; he never attained the assured manipulation
of Titian and Paul Veronese, not to
mention the free facility of Velasquez, or the
splendid audacity of Rubens. His natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
gifts were grand enough to have taken him
to a pitch of mastery that he never reached,
but his mechanical and scientific tendencies
would have their development also, and withdrew
so much time from art that every renewal
of his artistic labor was accompanied
by long and anxious reflection.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;education&rdquo; is used in senses so
different that confusion is not always avoided.
Some people mean by it the acquisition of
knowledge, others the development of faculty.
If you mean the first, then the half-educated
man would be a man who knew half
what he ought to know, or who only half
knew the different sciences, which the wholly
educated know thoroughly. Who is to fix
the subjects? Is it the opinion of the learned?&mdash;if
so, who are the learned? &ldquo;A learned
man!&mdash;a scholar!&mdash;a man of erudition! Upon
whom are these epithets of approbation bestowed?
Are they given to men acquainted
with the science of government? thoroughly
masters of the geographical and commercial
relations of Europe? to men who know the
properties of bodies, and their action upon
each other? No: this is not learning; it is
chemistry, or political economy, not learning.
The distinguishing abstract term, the epithet
of Scholar, is reserved for him who writes on
the Æolic reduplication, and is familiar with
the Sylburgian method of arranging defectives
in <span class="grk" title="ô">&#969;</span> and <span class="grk" title="mi">&#956;&#953;</span>. The picture which a young
Englishman, addicted to the pursuit of knowledge,
draws&mdash;his <i>beau idéal</i> of human nature&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
top and consummation of man&rsquo;s powers&mdash;is
a knowledge of the Greek language. His
object is not to reason, to imagine, or to invent;
but to conjugate, decline, and derive.
The situations of imaginary glory which he
draws for himself, are the detection of an anapæst
in the wrong place, or the restoration
of a dative case which Cranzius had passed
over, and the never-dying Ernesti failed to
observe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the help of the above passage from an
article written sixty-three years ago by Sydney
Smith, and by the help of another passage
in the same paper where he tells us that
the English clergy bring up the first young
men of the country as if they were all to keep
grammar schools in little country towns, I
begin to understand what you mean by a
half-educated person. You mean a person
who is only half qualified for keeping a grammar
school. In this sense it is very possible
that our friend the painter possesses nothing
beyond a miserable fraction of education.
And yet he has picked up a good deal of valuable
knowledge outside the technical acquirement
of a most difficult profession. He
studied two years in Paris, and four years in
Florence and Rome. He speaks French and
Italian quite fluently, and with a fair degree
of correctness. His knowledge of those two
languages is incomparably more complete, in
the sense of practical possession, than our
fossilized knowledge of Latin, and he reads
them almost as we read English, currently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
and without translating. He has the heartiest
enjoyment of good literature; there is
evidence in his pictures of a most intelligent
sympathy with the greatest inventive writers.
Without having a scientific nature, he
knows a good deal about anatomy. He has
not read Greek poetry, but he has studied the
old Greek mind in its architecture and sculpture.
Nature has also endowed him with a
just appreciation of music, and he knows the
immortal masterpieces of the most illustrious
composers. All these things would not qualify
him to teach a grammar school, and yet
what Greek of the age of Pericles ever knew
half so much?</p>

<p>This for the acquisition of knowledge; now
for the development of faculty. In this respect
he excels us as performing athletes excel
the people in the streets. Consider the
marvellous accuracy of his eye, the precision
of his hand, the closeness of his observation,
the vigor of his memory and invention!
How clumsy and rude is the most learned
pedant in comparison with the refinement of
this delicate organization! Try to imagine
what a disciplined creature he has become,
how obedient are all his faculties to the commands
of the central will! The brain conceives
some image of beauty or wit, and immediately
that clear conception is telegraphed
to the well-trained fingers. Surely, if the results
of education may be estimated from the
evidences of skill, here are some of the most
wonderful of such results.</p>

<h2>PART IV.</h2>

<h3>THE POWER OF TIME.</h3>
<hr class="full" />


<h3 class="pt3">LETTER I.</h3>

<h5>TO A MAN OF LEISURE WHO COMPLAINED OF
WANT OF TIME.</h5>

<p class="pro">Necessity for time-thrift in all cases&mdash;Serious men not much
in danger from mere frivolity&mdash;Greater danger of losing
time in our serious pursuits themselves&mdash;Time thrown
away when we do not attain proficiency&mdash;Soundness of
former scholarship a good example&mdash;Browning&rsquo;s Grammarian&mdash;Knowledge
an organic whole&mdash;Soundness the
possession of essential parts&mdash;Necessity of fixed limits in

of time to leave fortresses untaken in our rear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">You</span> complain of want of time&mdash;you, with
your boundless leisure!</p>

<p>It is true that the most absolute master of
his own hours still needs thrift if he would
turn them to account, and that too many
<i>never</i> learn this thrift, whilst others learn it
late. Will you permit me to offer briefly a
few observations on time-thrift which have
been suggested to me by my own experience
and by the experience of intellectual friends?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span> </p>

<p>It may be accepted for certain, to begin
with, that men who like yourself seriously
care for culture, and make it, next to moral
duty, the principal object of their lives, are
but little exposed to waste time in downright
frivolity of any kind. You may be perfectly
idle at your own times, and perfectly frivolous
even, whenever you have a mind to be
frivolous, but then you will be clearly aware
how the time is passing, and you will throw it
away knowingly, as the most careful of money-economists
will throw away a few sovereigns
in a confessedly foolish amusement,
merely for the relief of a break in the habit of
his life. To a man of your tastes and temper
there is no danger of wasting too much time
so long as the waste is intentional; but you
are exposed to time-losses of a much more insidious
character.</p>

<p>It is in our pursuits themselves that we
throw away our most valuable time. Few intellectual
men have the art of economizing
the hours of study. The very necessity,
which every one acknowledges, of giving vast
portions of life to attain proficiency in anything
makes us prodigal where we ought to be
parsimonious, and careless where we have
need of unceasing vigilance. The best time-savers
are the love of soundness in all we
learn or do, and a cheerful acceptance of inevitable
limitations. There is a certain point
of proficiency at which an acquisition begins
to be of use, and unless we have the time and
resolution necessary to reach that point, our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
labor is as completely thrown away as that of
a mechanic who began to make an engine but
never finished it. Each of us has acquisitions
which remain permanently unavailable
from their unsoundness, a language or two
that we can neither speak nor write, a science
of which the elements have not been mastered,
an art which we cannot practice with satisfaction
either to others or to ourselves. Now the
time spent on these unsound accomplishments
has been in great measure wasted, not quite
absolutely wasted, since the mere labor of trying
to learn has been a discipline for the
mind, but wasted so far as the accomplishments
themselves are concerned. And even
this mental discipline, on which so much
stress is laid by those whose interest it is to
encourage unsound accomplishment, might
be obtained more perfectly if the subjects of
study were less numerous and more thoroughly
understood. Let us not therefore in the
studies of our maturity repeat the error of
our youth. Let us determine to have soundness,
that is, accurately organized knowledge
in the studies we continue to pursue, and let
us resign ourselves to the necessity for abandoning
those pursuits in which soundness
is not to be hoped for.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned idea about scholarship in
Latin and Greek, that it ought to be based
upon thorough grammatical knowledge, is a
good example, so far as it goes, of what
soundness really is. That ideal of scholarship
failed only because it fell short of soundness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
in other directions and was not conscious
of its failure. But there existed, in the minds
of the old scholars, a fine resolution to be accurate,
and a determination to give however
much labor might be necessary for the attainment
of accuracy, in which there was much
grandeur. Like Mr. Browning&rsquo;s Grammarian,
they said&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Let me know all! Prate not of most or least</p>
<p class="i2">Painful or easy!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">and so at least they came to know the ancient
tongues grammatically, which few of us do in
these days.</p>

<p>I should define each kind of knowledge as
an organic whole and soundness as the complete
possession of all the essential parts.
For example, soundness in violin-playing consists
in being able to play the notes in all the
positions, in tune, and with a pure intonation,
whatever may be the degree of rapidity indicated
by the musical composer. Soundness
in painting consists in being able to lay a
patch of color having exactly the right shape
and tint. Soundness in the use of language
consists in being able to put the right word in
the right place. In each of the sciences, there
are certain elementary notions without which
sound knowledge is not possible, but these elementary
notions are more easily and rapidly
acquired than the elaborate knowledge or confirmed
skill necessary to the artist or the linguist.
A man may be a sound botanist without
knowing a very great number of plants, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
the elements of sound botanical knowledge
may be printed in a portable volume. And so
it is with all the physical sciences; the elementary
notions which are necessary to soundness
of knowledge may be acquired rapidly and
at any age. Hence it follows that all whose
leisure for culture is limited, and who value
soundness of knowledge, do wisely to pursue
some branch of natural history rather than
languages or the fine arts.</p>

<p>It is well for every one who desires to attain
a perfect economy of time, to make a list of
the different pursuits to which he has devoted
himself, and to put a note opposite to each of
them indicating the degree of its unsoundness
with as little self-delusion as may be. After
having done this, he may easily ascertain in
how many of these pursuits a sufficient degree
of soundness is attainable for him, and
when this has been decided he may at once
effect a great saving by the total renunciation
of the rest. With regard to those which
remain, and which are to be carried farther,
the next thing to be settled is the exact limit
of their cultivation. Nothing is so favorable
to sound culture as the definite fixing of limits.
Suppose, for example, that the student
said to himself &ldquo;I desire to know the flora of
the valley I live in,&rdquo; and then set to work
systematically to make a herbarium illustrating
that flora, it is probable that his labor
would be more thorough, his temper more
watchful and hopeful, than if he set himself to
the boundless task of the illimitable flora of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
the world. Or in the pursuit of fine art, an
amateur discouraged by the glaring unsoundness
of the kind of art taught by ordinary
drawing-masters, would find the basis of
a more substantial superstructure on a narrower
but firmer ground. Suppose that instead
of the usual messes of bad color and
bad form, the student produced work having
some definite and not unattainable purpose,
would there not be, here also, an assured economy
of time? Accurate drawing is the basis
of soundness in the fine arts, and an amateur,
by perseverance, may reach accuracy in drawing;
this, at least, has been proved by some
examples&mdash;not by many, certainly, but by
some. In languages we may have a limited
purpose also. That charming and most intelligent
traveller, Louis Énault, tells us that he
regularly gave a week to the study of each
new language that he needed, and found that
week sufficient. The assertion is not so presumptuous
as it appears. For the practical
necessities of travelling M. Énault found that
he required about four hundred words, and
that, having a good memory, he was able to
learn about seventy words a day. The secret
of his success was the invaluable art of selection,
and the strict limitation of effort in accordance
with a preconceived design. A
traveller not so well skilled in selection might
have learned a thousand words with less advantage
to his travels, and a traveller less decided
in purpose might have wasted several
months on the frontier of every new country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
in hopeless efforts to master the intricacies of
grammatical form. It is evident that in the
strictest sense M. Énault&rsquo;s knowledge of Norwegian
cannot have been sound, since he did
not master the grammar, but it was sound in
its own strictly limited way, since he got possession
of the four hundred words which were
to serve him as current coin. On the same
principle it is a good plan for students of Latin
and Greek who have not time to reach true
scholarship (half a lifetime is necessary for
that), to propose to themselves simply the
reading of the original authors with the help
of a literal translation. In this way they
may attain a closer acquaintance with ancient
literature than would be possible by
translation alone, whilst on the other hand
their reading will be much more extensive
on account of its greater rapidity. It is, for
most of us, a waste of time to read Latin and
Greek without a translation, on account of
the comparative slowness of the process; but
it is always an advantage to know what was
really said in the original, and to test the exactness
of the translator by continual reference
to the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the author.
When the knowledge of the ancient language
is not sufficient even for this, it may still be
of use for occasional comparison, even though
the passage has to be fought through <i>à coupes
de dictionnaire</i>. What most of us need in
reference to the ancient languages is a frank
resignation to a restriction of some kind. It
is simply impossible for men occupied as most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
of us are in other pursuits to reach perfect
scholarship in those languages, and if we
reached it we should not have time to maintain
it.</p>

<p>In modern languages it is not so easy to fix
limits satisfactorily. You may resolve to
read French or German without either writing
or speaking them, and that would be an
effectual limit, certainly. But in practice it
is found difficult to keep within that boundary
if ever you travel or have intercourse
with foreigners. And when once you begin
to speak, it is so humiliating to speak badly,
that a lover of soundness in accomplishment
will never rest perfectly satisfied until he
speaks like a cultivated native, which nobody
ever did except under peculiar family conditions.</p>

<p>In music the limits are found more easily.
The amateur musician is frequently not inferior
in feeling and taste to the more accomplished
professional, and by selecting those
compositions which require much feeling and
taste for their interpretation, but not so much
manual skill, he may reach a sufficient success.
The art is to choose the very simplest
music (provided of course that it is beautiful,
which it frequently is), and to avoid all technical
difficulties which are not really necessary
to the expression of feeling. The amateur
ought also to select the easiest instrument,
an instrument in which the notes are
made for him already, rather than one which
compels him to fix the notes as he is playing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
The violin tempts amateurs who have a deep
feeling for music because it renders feeling as
no other instrument can render it, but the
difficulty of just intonation is almost insuperable
unless the whole time is given to that
one instrument. It is a fatal error to perform
on several different instruments, and an
amateur who has done so may find a desirable
limitation in restricting himself to one.</p>

<p>Much time is saved by following pursuits
which help each other. It is a great help to a
landscape painter to know the botany of the
country he works in, for botany gives the
greatest possible distinctness to his memory
of all kinds of vegetation. Therefore, if a
landscape painter takes to the study of science
at all, he would do well to study botany,
which would be of use in his painting, rather
than chemistry or mathematics, which would
be entirely disconnected from it. The memory
easily retains the studies which are auxiliary
to the chief pursuit. Entomologists
remember plants well, the reason being that
they find insects in them, just as Leslie the
painter had an excellent memory for houses
where there were any good pictures to be
found.</p>

<p>The secret of order and proportion in our
studies is the true secret of economy in time.
To have one main pursuit and several auxiliaries,
but none that are not auxiliary, is the
true principle of arrangement. Many hard
workers have followed pursuits as widely disconnected
as possible, but this was for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
refreshment of absolute change, not for the
economy of time.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is a deplorable waste of time to
leave fortresses untaken in our rear. Whatever
has to be mastered ought to be mastered
so thoroughly that we shall not have to come
back to it when we ought to be carrying the
war far into the enemy&rsquo;s country. But to
study on this sound principle, we require not
to be hurried. And this is why, to a sincere
student, all external pressure, whether of
examiners, or poverty, or business engagements,
which causes him to leave work behind
him which was not done as it ought to
have been done, is so grievously, so intolerably
vexatious.</p>

of the Philistines about wasted time&mdash;Töpffer and Claude
Tillier&mdash;Retrospective miscalculations, and the regrets
that result from them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Have</span> you ever observed that we pay much
more attention to a wise passage when it is
quoted, than when we read it in the original
author? On the same principle, people will
give a higher price to a picture-dealer than
they would have given to the painter himself.
The picture that has been once bought has a
recommendation, and the quoted passage is
both recommended and isolated from the context.</p>

<p>Trusting to this well-known principle, although
I am aware that you have read everything
that Sir Arthur Helps has published, I
proceed to make the following quotation from
one of his wisest books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time and occasion are the two important
circumstances in human life, as regards which
the most mistaken estimates are made. And
the error is universal. It besets even the
most studious and philosophic men. This
may notably be seen in the present day, when
many most distinguished men have laid down
projects for literature and philosophy, to be
accomplished by them in their own lifetime,
which would require several men and many
lifetimes to complete; and, generally speaking,
if any person, who has passed the meridian
of life, looks back upon his career, he will
probably own that his greatest errors have
arisen from his not having made sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
allowance for the length of time which his
various schemes required for their fulfilment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are many traditional maxims about
time which insist upon its brevity, upon the
necessity of using it whilst it is there, upon
the impossibility of recovering what is lost;
but the practical effect of these maxims upon
conduct can scarcely be said to answer to
their undeniable importance. The truth is,
that although they tell us to economize our
time, they cannot, in the nature of things, instruct
us as to the methods by which it is to be
economized. Human life is so extremely various
and complicated, whilst it tends every
day to still greater variety and complication,
that all maxims of a general nature require
a far higher degree of intelligence in their
application to individual cases than it ever
cost originally to invent them. Any person
gifted with ordinary common sense can perceive
that life is short, that time flies, that
we ought to make good use of the present;
but it needs the union of much experience,
with the most consummate wisdom, to know
exactly what ought to be done and what
ought to be left undone&mdash;the latter being
frequently by far the more important of the
two.</p>

<p>Amongst the favorable influences of my
early life was the kindness of a venerable
country gentleman, who had seen a great
deal of the world and passed many years, before
he inherited his estates, in the practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
of a laborious profession. I remember a theory
of his, that experience was much less
valuable than is generally supposed, because,
except in matters of simple routine, the problems
that present themselves to us for solution
are nearly always dangerous from the
presence of some unknown element. The unknown
element he regarded as a hidden pitfall,
and he warned me that in my progress
through life I might always expect to tumble
into it. This saying of his has been so often
confirmed since then, that I now count upon
the pitfall quite as a matter of certainty.
Very frequently I have escaped it, but more
by good luck than good management. Sometimes
I have tumbled into it, and when this
misfortune occurred it has not unfrequently
been in consequence of having acted upon the
advice of some very knowing and experienced
person indeed. We have all read,
when we were boys, Captain Marryat&rsquo;s &ldquo;Midshipman
Easy.&rdquo; There is a passage in that
story which may serve as an illustration of
what is constantly happening in actual life.
The boats of the <i>Harpy</i> were ordered to board
one of the enemy&rsquo;s vessels; young Easy was
in command of one of these boats, and as
they had to wait he began to fish. After they
had received the order to advance, he delayed
a little to catch his fish, and this delay not
only saved him from being sunk by the enemy&rsquo;s
broadside, but enabled him to board
the Frenchman. Here the pitfall was avoided
by idling away a minute of time on an occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
when minutes were like hours; yet it
was mere luck, not wisdom, which led to the
good result. There was a sad railway accident
on one of the continental lines last
autumn; a notable personage would have
been in the train if he had arrived in time for
it, but his miscalculation saved him. In matters
where there is no risk of the loss of life,
but only of the waste of a portion of it in unprofitable
employment, it frequently happens
that procrastination, which is reputed to be
the thief of time, becomes its best preserver.
Suppose that you undertake an enterprise,
but defer the execution of it from day to day:
it is quite possible that in the interval some
fact may accidentally come to your knowledge
which would cause a great modification
of your plan, or even its complete abandonment.
Every thinking person is well aware
that the enormous loss of time caused by the
friction of our legislative machinery has preserved
the country from a great deal of crude
and ill-digested legislation. Even Napoleon
the Great who had a rapidity of conception
and of action so far surpassing that of other
kings and commanders that it seems to us almost
supernatural, said that when you did
not quite know what ought to be done it was
best to do nothing at all. One of the most
distinguished of living painters said exactly
the same thing with reference to the practice
of his art, and added that very little time
would be needed for the actual execution of a
picture if only the artist knew beforehand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
how and where to lay the color. It so often
happens that mere activity is a waste of time,
that people who have a morbid habit of being
busy are often terrible time-wasters, whilst,
on the contrary, those who are judiciously deliberate,
and allow themselves intervals of
leisure, see the way before them in those intervals,
and save time by the accuracy of
their calculations.</p>

<p>A largely intelligent thrift of time is necessary
to all great works&mdash;and many works are
very great indeed relatively to the energies
of a single individual, which pass unperceived
in the tumult of the world. The advantages
of calculating time are artistic as
well as economical. I think that, in this
respect, magnificent as are the cathedrals
which the Gothic builders have left us, they
committed an artistic error in the very immensity
of their plans. They do not appear
to have reflected that from the continual
changes of fashion in architecture, incongruous
work would be sure to intrude itself before
their gigantic projects could be realized
by the generations that were to succeed them.
For a work of that kind to possess artistic
unity, it ought to be completely realized
within the space of forty years. How great
is the charm of those perfect edifices which,
like the Sainte Chapelle, are the realization
of one sublime idea? And those changes in
national thought which have made the old
cathedrals a jumble of incongruous styles,
have their parallel in the life of every individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
workman. We change from year to
year, and any work which occupies us for
very long will be wanting in unity of manner.</p>

<p>Men are apt enough of themselves to fall
into the most astonishing delusions about the
opportunities which time affords, but they
are even more deluded by the talk of the
people about them. When children hear
that a new carriage has been ordered of the
builder, they expect to see it driven up to the
door in a fortnight, with the paint quite dry
on the panels. All people are children in this
respect, except the workman, who knows the
endless details of production; and the workman
himself, notwithstanding the lessons of
experience, makes light of the future task.
What gigantic plans we scheme, and how little
we advance in the labor of a day! Three
pages of the book (to be half erased to-morrow),
a bit of drapery in the picture that will
probably have to be done over again, the imperceptible
removal of an ounce of marble-dust
from the statue that seems as if it never
would be finished; so much from dawn to
twilight has been the accomplishment of the
golden hours. If there is one lesson which
experience teaches, surely it is this, to make
plans that are strictly limited, and to arrange
our work in a practicable way within the
limits that we must accept. Others expect
so much from us that it seems as if we had
accomplished nothing. &ldquo;What! have you
done only that?&rdquo; they say, or we know by
their looks that they are thinking it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span> </p>

<p>The most illusory of all the work that we
propose to ourselves is reading. It seems so
easy to read, that we intend, in the indefinite
future, to master the vastest literatures. We
cannot bring ourselves to admit that the library
we have collected is in great part closed
to us simply by want of time. A dear friend
of mine, who was a solicitor with a large practice,
indulged in wonderful illusions about
reading, and collected several thousand volumes,
all fine editions, but he died without
having cut their leaves. I like the university
habit of making reading a business, and estimating
the mastery of a few authors as a just
title to consideration for scholarship. I should
like very well to be shut up in a garden for a
whole summer with no literature but the &ldquo;Faëry
Queene,&rdquo; and one year I very nearly realized
that project, but publishers and the postman
interfered with it. After all, this business
of reading ought to be less illusory than most
others, for printers divide books into pages,
which they number, so that, with a moderate
skill in arithmetic, one ought to be able to
foresee the limits of his possibilities. There is
another observation which may be suggested,
and that is to take note of the time required
for reading different languages. We read
very slowly when the language is imperfectly
mastered, and we need the dictionary, whereas
in the native tongue we see the whole page
almost at a glance, as if it were a picture.
People whose time for reading is limited
ought not to waste it in grammars and dictionaries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
but to confine themselves resolutely
to a couple of languages, or three at the very
utmost, notwithstanding the contempt of
polyglots, who estimate your learning by the
variety of your tongues. It is a fearful throwing
away of time, from the literary point of
view, to begin more languages than you can
master or retain, and to be always puzzling
yourself about irregular verbs.</p>

<p>All plans for sparing time in intellectual
matters ought, however, to proceed upon the
principle of thrift, and not upon the principle
of avarice. The object of the thrifty
man in money matters is so to lay out his
money as to get the best possible result from
his expenditure; the object of the avaricious
man is to spend no more money than he can
help. An artist who taught me painting often
repeated a piece of advice which is valuable
in other things than art, and which I try to
remember whenever patience fails. He used
to say to me, &ldquo;<i>Give it time.</i>&rdquo; The mere length
of time that we bestow upon our work is in
itself a most important element of success,
and if I object to the use of languages that we
only half know, it is not because it takes us a
long time to get through a chapter, but because
we are compelled to think about syntax
and conjugations which did not in the least
occupy the mind of the author, when we
ought rather to be thinking about those things
which <i>did</i> occupy his mind, about the events
which he narrated, or the characters that he
imagined or described. There are, in truth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
only two ways of impressing anything on the
memory, either intensity or duration. If you
saw a man struck down by an assassin, you
would remember the occurrence all your life;
but to remember with equal vividness a picture
of the assassination, you would probably
be obliged to spend a month or two in copying
it. The subjects of our studies rarely produce
an intensity of emotion sufficient to ensure
perfect recollection without the expenditure
of time. And when your object is not to
learn, but to produce, it is well to bear in mind
that everything requires a certain definite
time-outlay, which <i>cannot</i> be reduced without
an inevitable injury to quality. A most experienced
artist, a man of the very rarest executive
ability, wrote to me the other day
about a set of designs I had suggested. &ldquo;If
I could but get the TIME,&rdquo;&mdash;the large capitals
are his own,&mdash;&ldquo;for, somehow or other, let a
design be never so studiously simple in the
masses, it <i>will</i> fill itself as it goes on, like the
weasel in the fable who got into the meal-tub;
and when the pleasure begins in attempting
tone and mystery and intricacy, <i>away go the
hours at a gallop</i>.&rdquo; A well-known and very
successful English dramatist wrote to me:
&ldquo;When I am hurried, and have undertaken
more work than I can execute in the time at
my disposal, I am always perfectly paralyzed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is another side to this subject which
deserves attention. Some men work best under
the sense of pressure. Simple compression
evolves heat from iron, so that there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
a flash of fire when a ball hits the side of an
ironclad. The same law seems to hold good
in the intellectual life of man, whenever he
needs the stimulus of extraordinary excitement.
Rossini positively advised a young
composer never to write his overture until
the evening before the first performance.
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;excites inspiration like
necessity; the presence of a copyist waiting
for your work, and the view of a manager in
despair tearing out his hair by handfuls. In
Italy in my time all the managers were bald
at thirty. I composed the overture to &lsquo;Othello&rsquo;
in a small room in the Barbaja Palace,
where the baldest and most ferocious of managers
had shut me up by force with nothing
but a dish of maccaroni, and the threat that I
should not leave the place alive until I had
written the last note. I wrote the overture
to the &lsquo;Gazza Ladra&rsquo; on the day of the first
performance, in the upper loft of the La
Scala, where I had been confined by the manager,
under the guard of four scene-shifters
who had orders to throw my text out of the
window bit by bit to copyists, who were waiting
below to transcribe it. In default of
music I was to be thrown out myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have quoted the best instance known to
me of this voluntary seeking after pressure,
but striking as it is, even this instance
does not weaken what I said before. For
observe, that although Rossini deferred the
composition of his overture till the evening
before the first performance, he knew very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
well that he could do it thoroughly in the
time. He was like a clever schoolboy who
knows that he can learn his lesson in the
quarter of an hour before the class begins; or
he was like an orator who knows that he can
deliver a passage and compose at the same
time the one which is to follow, so that he
prefers to arrange his speech in the presence
of his audience. Since Rossini always allowed
himself all the time that was necessary
for what he had to do, it is clear that he did
not sin against the great time-necessity. The
express which can travel from London to
Edinburgh in a night may leave the English
metropolis on Saturday evening although it
is due in Scotland on Sunday, and still act
with the strictest consideration about time.
The blameable error lies in miscalculation,
and not in rapidity of performance.</p>

<p>Nothing <i>wastes</i> time like miscalculation. It
negatives all results. It is the parent of incompleteness,
the great author of the Unfinished
and the Unserviceable. Almost every
intellectual man has laid out great masses of
time on five or six different branches of knowledge
which are not of the least use to him,
simply because he has not carried them far
enough, and could not carry them far enough
in the time he had to give. Yet this might have
been ascertained at the beginning by the simplest
arithmetical calculation. The experience
of students in all departments of knowledge
has quite definitely ascertained the amount of
time that is necessary for success in them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
the successful student can at once inform the
aspirant how far he is likely to travel along
the road. What is the use, to anybody, of
having just enough skill to feel vexed with
himself that he has no more, and yet angry at
other people for not admiring the little that he
possesses?</p>

<p>I wish to direct your attention to a cause
which more than any other produces disappointment
in ordinary intellectual pursuits.
It is this. People can often calculate with the
utmost accuracy what they can accomplish in
ten minutes or even in ten hours, and yet the
very same persons will make the most absurd
miscalculations about what they can accomplish
in ten years. There is of course a reason
for this: if there were not, so many sensible
people would not suffer from the delusion.
The reason is, that owing to the habits of human
life there is a certain elasticity in large
spaces of time that include nights, and mealtimes,
and holidays. We fancy that we shall
be able, by working harder than we have been
accustomed to work, and by stealing hours
from all the different kinds of rest and amusement,
to accomplish far more in the ten years
that are to come than we have ever actually
accomplished in the same space. And to a
certain extent this may be very true. No doubt
a man whose mind has become seriously aware
of the vast importance of economizing his time
will economize it better than he did in the days
before the new conviction came to him. No
doubt, after skill in our work has been confirmed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
we shall perform it with increased
speed. But the elasticity of time is rather
that of leather than that of india-rubber.
There is certainly a degree of elasticity, but
the degree is strictly limited. The true master
of time-thrift would be no more liable to
illusion about years than about hours, and
would act as prudently when working for remote
results as for near ones.</p>

<p>Not that we ought to work as if we were always
under severe pressure. Little books are
occasionally published in which we are told
that it is a sin to lose a minute. From the intellectual
point of view this doctrine is simply
stupid. What the Philistines call wasted
time is often rich in the most varied experience
to the intelligent. If all that we have learned
in idle moments could be suddenly expelled
from our minds by some chemical process, it
is probable that they would be worth very little
afterwards. What, after such a process,
would have remained to Shakespeare, Scott,
Cervantes, Thackeray, Dickens, Hogarth,
Goldsmith, Molière? When these great students
of human nature were learning most,
the sort of people who write the foolish little
books just alluded to would have wanted to
send them home to the dictionary or the
desk. Töpffer and Claude Tillier, both men of
delicate and observant genius, attached the
greatest importance to hours of idleness.
Töpffer said that a year of downright loitering
was a desirable element in a liberal education;
whilst Claude Tillier went even farther, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
boldly affirmed that &ldquo;le temps le mieux employé
est celui que l&rsquo;on perd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us not think too contemptuously of the
miscalculators of time, since not one of us is
exempt from their folly. We have all made
miscalculations, or more frequently have simply
omitted calculation altogether, preferring
childish illusion to a manly examination of
realities; and afterwards as life advances
another illusion steals over us not less vain
than the early one, but bitter as that was
sweet. We now begin to reproach ourselves
with all the opportunities that have been
neglected, and now our folly is to imagine
that we might have done impossible wonders
if we had only exercised a little resolution.
We might have been thorough classical scholars,
and spoken all the great modern languages,
and written immortal books, and
made a colossal fortune. Miscalculations
again, and these the most imbecile of all; for
the youth who forgets to reason in the glow
of happiness and hope, is wiser than the man
who overestimates what was once possible
that he may embitter the days which remain
to him.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO A MAN OF BUSINESS WHO DESIRED TO MAKE
HIMSELF BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH LITERATURE,
BUT WHOSE TIME FOR READING WAS
LIMITED.</h5>

<p class="pro">Victor Jacquemont on the intellectual labors of the Germans&mdash;Business
may be set off as the equivalent to one of their
pursuits&mdash;Necessity for regularity in the economy of time&mdash;What
may be done in two hours a day&mdash;Evils of interruption&mdash;Florence
Nightingale&mdash;Real nature of interruption&mdash;Instance
from the Apology of Socrates.</p>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> the charming and precious letters of
Victor Jacquemont, a man whose life was
dedicated to culture, and who not only lived
for it, but died for it, there is a passage about
the intellectual labors of Germans, which
takes due account of the expenditure of time.
&ldquo;Comme j&rsquo;étais étonné,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;de la
prodigieuse variété et de l&rsquo;étendue de connaissances
des Allemands, je demandai un jour à
l&rsquo;un de mes amis, Saxon de naissance et l&rsquo;un
des premiers géologues de l&rsquo;Europe, comment
ses compatriotes s&rsquo;y prenaient pour savoir
tant de choses. Voici sa réponse, à peu près:
&lsquo;Un Allemand (moi excepté qui suis le plus
paresseux des hommes) se lève de bonne heure,
été et hiver, à cinq heures environ. Il travaille
quatre heures avant le déjeuner, fumant
quelquefois pendant tout ce temps, sans que
cela nuise à son application. Son déjeuner
dure une demi-heure, et il reste, après, une
autre demi-heure à causer avec sa femme et à
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
faire jouer ses enfants. Il retourne au travail
pour six heures; dîne sans se presser; fume
une heure après le dîner, jouant encore avec
ses enfants; et avant de se coucher il travaille
encore quatre heures. Il recommence
tous les jours, ne sortant jamais.&mdash;Voilà,&rsquo; me
dit mon ami, &lsquo;comment Oersted, le plus grand
physicien de l&rsquo;Allemagne, en est aussi le plus
grand médecin; voilà comment Kant le métaphysicien
était un des plus savants astronomes
de l&rsquo;Europe, et comment Goethe, qui en
est actuellement le premier littérateur, dans
presque tous les genres, et le plus fécond, est
excellent botaniste, minéralogiste, physicien.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_2" id="FnAnchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>Here is something to encourage, and something
to discourage you at the same time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
The number of hours which these men have
given in order to become what they were, is
so great as to be past all possibility of imitation
by a man occupied in business. It is clear
that, with your counting-house to occupy you
during the best hours of every day, you can
never labor for your intellectual culture with
that unremitting application which these men
have given for theirs. But, on the other hand,
you will perceive that these extraordinary
workers have hardly ever been wholly dedicated
to one pursuit, and the reason for this
in most cases is clear. Men who go through
a prodigious amount of work feel the necessity
for varying it. The greatest intellectual workers
I have known personally have varied their
studies as Kant and Goethe did, often taking
up subjects of the most opposite kinds, as for
instance imaginative literature and the higher
mathematics, the critical and practical study
of fine art and the natural sciences, music,
and political economy. The class of intellects
which arrogate to themselves the epithet
&ldquo;practical,&rdquo; but which we call <i>Philistine</i>,
always oppose this love of variety, and have
an unaffected contempt for it, but these are
matters beyond their power of judgment.
They cannot know the needs of the intellectual
life, because they have never lived it. The
practice of all the greatest intellects has been
to cultivate themselves variously, and if they
have always done so, it must be because they
have felt the need of it.</p>

<p>The encouraging inference which you may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
draw from this in reference to your own case
is that, since all intellectual men have had
more than one pursuit, you may set off your
business against the most absorbing of their
pursuits, and for the rest be still almost as
rich in time as they have been. You may
study literature as some painters have studied
it, or science as some literary men have
studied it.</p>

<p>The first step is to establish a regulated
economy of your time, so that, without interfering
with a due attention to business and to
health, you may get two clear hours every day
for reading of the best kind. It is not much,
some men would tell you that it is not enough,
but I purposely fix the expenditure of time at
a low figure because I want it to be always
practicable consistently with all the duties
and necessary pleasures of your life. If I told
you to read four hours every day, I know beforehand
what would be the consequence.
You would keep the rule for three days, by
an effort, then some engagement would occur
to break it, and you would have no rule at all.
And please observe that the two hours are to
be given quite regularly, because, when the
time given is not much, regularity is quite
essential. Two hours a day, regularly, make
more than seven hundred hours in a year, and
in seven hundred hours, wisely and uninterruptedly
occupied, much may be done in anything.</p>

<p>Permit me to insist upon that word <i>uninterruptedly</i>.
Few people realize the full evil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
of an interruption, few people know all that is
implied by it. After warning nurses against
the evils of interruption, Florence Nightingale
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These things are not fancy. If we consider
that, with sick as with well, every
thought decomposes some nervous matter&mdash;that
decomposition as well as re-composition
of nervous matter is always going on, and
more quickly with the sick than with the
well,&mdash;that to obtrude another thought upon
the brain whilst it is in the act of destroying
nervous matter by thinking, is calling upon it
to make a new exertion&mdash;if we consider these
things, which are facts, not fancies, we shall
remember that we are doing positive injury
by interrupting, by startling a &lsquo;fanciful&rsquo; person,
as it is called. Alas, it is no fancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the invalid is forced by his avocations to
continue occupations requiring much thinking,
the injury is doubly great. In feeding a
patient suffering under delirium or stupor
you may suffocate him by giving him his
food suddenly, but if you rub his lips gently
with a spoon and thus attract his attention, he
will swallow the food unconsciously, but with
perfect safety. Thus it is with the brain. If
you offer it a thought, especially one requiring
a decision, abruptly, you do it a real, not
fanciful, injury. Never speak to a sick person
suddenly; but, at the same time, do not
keep his expectation on the tiptoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this you will already have answered,
mentally, that you are not a patient suffering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
under either delirium or stupor, and that nobody
needs to rub your lips gently with a
spoon. But Miss Nightingale does not consider
interruption baneful to sick persons
only.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This rule indeed,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;applies
to the well quite as much as to the sick. <i>I
have never known persons who exposed themselves
for years to constant interruption who
did not muddle away their intellects by it at
last.</i> The process, with them, may be accomplished
without pain. With the sick, pain
gives warning of the injury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Interruption is an evil to the reader which
must be estimated very differently from ordinary
business interruptions. The great question
about interruption is not whether it compels
you to divert your attention to other
facts, but whether it compels you to tune
your whole mind to another diapason. Shopkeepers
are incessantly compelled to change
the subject; a stationer is asked for notepaper
one minute, for sealing-wax the next,
and immediately afterwards for a particular
sort of steel pen. The subjects of his thoughts
are changed very rapidly, but the general
state of his mind is not changed; he is always
strictly in his shop, as much mentally as
physically. When an attorney is interrupted
in the study of a case by the arrival of a client
who asks him questions about another
case, the change is more difficult to bear; yet
even here the general state of mind, the legal
state of mind, is not interfered with. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
now suppose a reader perfectly absorbed in
his author, an author belonging very likely
to another age and another civilization entirely
different from ours. Suppose that you
are reading the Defence of Socrates in Plato,
and have the whole scene before you as in a
picture: the tribunal of the Five Hundred,
the pure Greek architecture, the interested
Athenian public, the odious Melitus, the envious
enemies, the beloved and grieving
friends whose names are dear to us, and immortal;
and in the centre you see one figure
draped like a poor man, in cheap and common
cloth, that he wears winter and summer,
with a face plain to downright ugliness, but
an air of such genuine courage and self-possession
that no acting could imitate it; and
you hear the firm voice saying&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">You are just beginning the splendid paragraph
where Socrates condemns himself to
maintenance in the Prytaneum, and if you
can only be safe from interruption till it is
finished, you will have one of those minutes
of noble pleasure which are the rewards of
intellectual toil. But if you are reading in
the daytime in a house where there are women
and children, or where people can fasten
upon you for pottering details of business,
you may be sure that you will <i>not</i> be able to
get to the end of the passage without in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
way or other being rudely awakened from
your dream, and suddenly brought back into
the common world. The loss intellectually is
greater than any one who had not suffered
from it could imagine. People think that an
interruption is merely the unhooking of an
electric chain, and that the current will flow,
when the chain is hooked on again, just as it
did before. To the intellectual and imaginative
student an interruption is not that; it is
the destruction of a picture.</p>

<h5>TO A STUDENT WHO FELT HURRIED AND DRIVEN.</h5>

<p class="pro">People who like to be hurried&mdash;Sluggish temperaments gain
vivacity under pressure&mdash;Routine work may be done at increased
speed&mdash;The higher intellectual work cannot be done
hurriedly&mdash;The art of avoiding hurry consists in Selection&mdash;How
it was practised by a good landscape painter&mdash;Selection
in reading and writing&mdash;Some studies allow the play of

fulfilment of literary engagements.</p>

<p><span class="sc">So</span> you have got yourself into that pleasant
condition which is about as agreeable, and as
favorable to fruitful study and observation,
as the condition of an over-driven cab-horse!</p>

<p>Very indolent men, who will not work at
all unless under the pressure of immediate
urgency, sometimes tell us that they actually
like to be hurried; but although certain kinds
of practical work which have become perfectly
easy from habit may be got through at
a great pace when the workman feels that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
there is an immediate necessity for effort, it
is certainly not true that hurry is favorable
to sound study of any kind. Work which
merely runs in a fixed groove may be urged
on occasionally at express speed without any
perceptible injury to the quality of it. A
clever violinist can play a passage <i>prestissimo</i>
as correctly as if he played it <i>adagio</i>; a banker&rsquo;s
clerk can count money very rapidly with
positively less risk of error than if he counted
it as you and I do. A person of sluggish temperament
really gains in vivacity when he is
pressed for time, and becomes during those
moments of excited energy a clearer-headed
and more able person than he is under ordinary
circumstances. It is therefore not surprising
that he should find himself able to accomplish
more under the great stimulus of an
immediate necessity than he is able to do in
the dulness of his every-day existence. Great
prodigies of labor have been performed in
this way to avert impending calamity, especially
by military officers in critical times like
those of the Sepoy rebellion; and in the obscurer
lives of tradesmen, immense exertions
are often made to avert the danger of bankruptcy,
when without the excitement of a serious
anxiety of that kind the tradesman
would not feel capable of more than a moderate
and reasonable degree of attention to his
affairs. But notwithstanding the many instances
of this kind which might be cited,
and the many more which might easily be
collected, the truth remains that the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
kinds of intellectual labor can hardly ever be
properly performed when the degree of pressure
is in the least excessive. You may, for
example, if you have the kind of ability
which makes a good journalist, write an effective
leader with your watch lying on the
table, and finish it exactly when the time is
up; but if you had the kind of ability which
makes a good poet, you could not write anything
like highly-finished poetry against time.
It is equally clear that scientific discovery,
which, though it may flash suddenly upon
the mind of the discoverer, is always the result
of long brooding over the most patient
observations, must come at its own moments,
and cannot be commanded. The activity of
poets and discoverers would be paralyzed by
exigencies which stimulate the activity of
soldiers and men of business. The truth is,
that intelligence and energy are beneficially
stimulated by pressure from without, whereas
the working of the higher intellect is impeded
by it, and that to such a degree that in
times of the greatest pressure the high intellectual
life is altogether suspended, to leave
free play to the lower but more immediately
serviceable intelligence.</p>

<p>This being so, it becomes a necessary part
of the art of intellectual living so to order our
work as to shield ourselves if possible, at
least during a certain portion of our time,
from the evil consequences of hurry. The
whole secret lies in a single word&mdash;Selection.</p>

<p>An excellent landscape painter told me that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
whatever he had to do, he always took the
greatest pains to arrange his work so as
never to have his tranquillity disturbed by
haste. His system, which is quite applicable
to many other things than landscape painting,
was based on the principle of selection.
He always took care to determine beforehand
how much time he could devote to each
sketch or study, and then, from the mass of
natural facts before him, selected the most
valuable facts which could be recorded in the
time at his disposal. But however short that
time might be, he was always perfectly cool
and deliberate in the employment of it. Indeed
this coolness and his skill in selection
helped each other mutually, for he chose
wisely because he was cool, and he had time
to be cool by reason of the wisdom of his
selection. In his little memoranda, done in
five minutes, the lines were laid just as deliberately
as the tints on an elaborate picture;
the difference being in choice only, not in
speed.</p>

<p>Now if we apply this art of selection to all
our labors it will give us much of that landscape
painter&rsquo;s enviable coolness, and enable
us to work more satisfactorily. Suppose that
instead of painting and sketching we have to
do a great deal of reading and writing: the
art is to select the reading which will be most
useful to our purpose, and, in writing, to select
the words which will express our meaning
with the greatest clearness in a little
space. The art of reading is to skip judiciously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
Whole libraries may be skipped in
these days, when we have the results of them
in our modern culture without going over the
ground again. And even of the books we decide
to read, there are almost always large
portions which do not concern us, and which
we are sure to forget the day after we have
read them. The art is to skip all that does
not concern us, whilst missing nothing that
we really need. No external guidance can
teach us this; for nobody but ourselves can
guess what the needs of our intellect may be.
But let us select with decisive firmness, independently
of other people&rsquo;s advice, independently
of the authority of custom. In every
newspaper that comes to hand there is a little
bit that we ought to read; the art is to find
that little bit, and waste no time over the
rest.</p>

<p>Some studies permit the exercise of selection
better than others do. A language, once
undertaken, permits very little selection indeed,
since you must know the whole vocabulary,
or nearly so, to be able to read and
speak. On the other hand, the natural sciences
permit the most prudent exercise of selection.
For example, in botany you may
study as few plants as you choose.</p>

<p>In writing, the art of selection consists in
giving the utmost effect to expression in the
fewest words; but of this art I say little, for
who can contend against an inevitable trade-necessity?
Almost every author of ordinary
skill could, when pressed for time, find a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
briefer expression for his thoughts, but the
real difficulty in fulfilling literary engagements
does not lie in the expression of the
thought, it lies in the sufficiently rapid production
of a certain quantity of copy. For
this purpose I fear that selection would be of
very little use&mdash;of no more use, in fact, than
in any other branch of manufacture where (if
a certain standard is kept up to) quantity in
sale is more important than quality of material.</p>

<h3>LETTER V.</h3>

<h5>TO A FRIEND WHO, THOUGH HE HAD NO PROFESSION,
COULD NOT FIND TIME FOR HIS VARIOUS
INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS.</h5>

<p class="pro">Compensations resulting from the necessity for time&mdash;Opportunity
only exists for us so far as we have time to make
use of it&mdash;This <i>or</i> that, not this <i>and</i> that&mdash;Danger of apparently
unlimited opportunities&mdash;The intellectual training
of our ancestors&mdash;Montaigne the Essayist&mdash;Reliance
upon the compensations.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> has always seemed to me that the great
and beautiful principle of compensation is
more clearly seen in the distribution and
effects of time than in anything else within
the scope of our experience. The good use of
one opportunity very frequently compensates
us for the absence of another, and it does so
because opportunity is itself so dependent
upon time that, although the best opportunities
may apparently be presented to us, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
can make no use of them unless we are able
to give them the time that they require. You,
who have the best possible opportunities for
culture, find a certain sadness and disappointment
because you cannot avail yourself of all
of them; but the truth is, that opportunity
only exists for us just so far as we are able to
make use of it, and our power to do so is
often nothing but a question of time. If our
days are well employed we are sure to have
done some good thing which we should have
been compelled to neglect if we had been occupied
about anything else. Hence every
genuine worker has rich compensations
which ought to console him amply for his
shortcomings, and to enable him to meet
comparisons without fear.</p>

<p>Those who aspire to the intellectual life, but
have no experience of its difficulties, very frequently
envy men so favorably situated as
you are. It seems to them that all the world&rsquo;s
knowledge is accessible to you, and that you
have simply to cull its fruits as we gather
grapes in a vineyard. They forget the power
of Time, and the restrictions which Time imposes.
&ldquo;This <i>or</i> that, not this <i>and</i> that,&rdquo; is
the rule to which all of us have to submit, and
it strangely equalizes the destinies of men.
The time given to the study of one thing is
withdrawn from the study of another, and the
hours of the day are limited alike for all of us.
How difficult it is to reconcile the interests of
our different pursuits! Indeed it seems like
a sort of polygamy to <i>have</i> different pursuits.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
It is natural to think of them as jealous wives
tormenting some Mormon prophet.</p>

<p>There is great danger in apparently unlimited
opportunities, and a splendid compensation
for those who are confined by circumstances
to a narrow but fruitful field. The
Englishman gets more civilization out of a
farm and a garden than the Red Indian out of
the space encircled by his horizon. Our culture
gains in thoroughness what it loses in extent.</p>

<p>This consideration goes far to explain the fact
that although our ancestors were so much less
favorably situated than we are, they often got
as good an intellectual training from the literature
that was accessible to them, as we from
our vaster stores. We live in an age of essayists,
and yet what modern essayist writes
better than old Montaigne? All that a thoughtful
and witty writer needs for the sharpening
of his intellect, Montaigne found in the ancient
literature that was accessible to him, and in
the life of the age he lived in. Born in our own
century, he would have learned many other
things, no doubt, and read many other books,
but these would have absorbed the hours that
he employed not less fruitfully with the
authors that he loved in the little library up
in the third story of his tower, as he tells us,
where he could see all his books at once, set
upon five rows of shelves round about him.
In earlier life he bought &ldquo;this sort of furniture&rdquo;
for &ldquo;ornament and outward show,&rdquo;
but afterwards quite abandoned that, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
procured such volumes only &ldquo;as supplied his
own need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To supply our own need, within the narrow
limits of the few and transient hours that we
can call our own, is enough for the wise everywhere,
as it was for Montaigne in his tower.
Let us resolve to do as much as that, not
more, and then rely upon the golden compensations.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Supposing that the executive and critical powers
always exist in some correspondent degree in the same person,
still they cannot be cultivated to the same extent. The
attention required for the development of a theory is necessarily
withdrawn from the design of a drawing, and the time
devoted to the realization of a form is lost to the solution of
a problem.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Ruskin</span>, <i>in the preface to the third volume
of</i> &ldquo;<i>Modern Painters</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the case of Mr. Ruskin, in that of Mr. Dante Rossetti,
and in all cases where the literary and artistic gifts are naturally
pretty evenly balanced, the preponderance of an hour a
day given to one or the other class of studies may have settled
the question whether the student was to be chiefly artist
or chiefly author. The enormous importance of the distribution
of time is never more clearly manifested than in cases of
this kind. Mr. Ruskin might certainly have attained rank as
a painter, Rossetti might have been as prolific in poetry as
he is excellent. What these gifted men are now is not so
much a question of talent as of time. In like manner the
question whether Ingres was to be known as a painter or as a
violinist was settled by the employment of hours rather than
by any preponderance of faculty.</p></div>

extent of knowledge possessed by the Germans, I begged one
of my friends, Saxon by birth, and one of the foremost geologists
in Europe, to tell me how his countrymen managed to
know so many things. Here is his answer, nearly in his own
words:&mdash;&lsquo;A German (except myself, who am the idlest of
men) gets up early, summer and winter, at about five o&rsquo;clock.
He works four hours before breakfast, sometimes smoking
all the time, which does not interfere with his application.
His breakfast lasts half an hour, and he remains, afterwards,
another half-hour talking with his wife and playing with his
children. He returns to his work for six hours, dines without
hurrying himself, smokes an hour after dinner, playing again
with his children, and before he goes to bed he works four
hours more. He begins again every day, and never goes out.
This is how it comes to pass that Oersted, the greatest natural
philosopher in Germany, is at the same time the greatest
physician; this is how Kant the metaphysician was one of
the most learned astronomers in Europe, and how Goethe,

in almost all kinds of literature, is an excellent botanist, mineralogist,
and natural philosopher.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="pt3">LETTER I.</h3>

<h5>TO A VERY RICH STUDENT.</h5>

<p class="pro">The author of &ldquo;Vathek&rdquo;&mdash;The double temptation of wealth&mdash;Rich
men tempted to follow occupations in which their
wealth is useful&mdash;Pressure of social duties on the rich&mdash;The
Duchess of Orleans&mdash;The rich man&rsquo;s time not his
own&mdash;The rich may help the general intellectual advancement
by the exercise of patronage&mdash;Dr. Carpenter&mdash;Franz
W&oelig;pke.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> has always seemed to me a very remarkable
and noteworthy circumstance that although
Mr. Beckford, the author of &ldquo;Vathek,&rdquo;
produced in his youth a story which
bears all the signs of true inventive genius, he
never produced anything in after-life which
posterity cares to preserve. I read &ldquo;Vathek&rdquo;
again quite recently, to see how far my early
enthusiasm for it might have been due to
that passion for orientalism which reigned
amongst us many years ago, but this fresh
perusal left an impression which only genius
leaves. Beckford really had invention, and
an extraordinary narrative power. That
such faculties, after having once revealed
themselves, should contentedly have remained
dormant ever afterwards, is one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
the most curious facts in the history of the
human mind, and it is the more curious that
Beckford lived to a very advanced age.</p>

<p>Beckford&rsquo;s case appears to have been one of
those in which great wealth diminishes or
wholly paralyzes the highest energy of the
intellect, leaving the lower energies free to
exert less noble kinds of activity. A refined
self-indulgence became the habit of his life,
and he developed simply into a dilettant.
Even his love for the fine arts did not rise
above the indulgence of an elegant and cultivated
taste. Although he lived at the very
time most favorable to the appearance of a
great critic in architecture and painting, the
time of a great architectural revival and of
the growth of a vigorous and independent
school of contemporary art, he exercised no
influence beyond that of a wealthy virtuoso.
His love of the beautiful began and ended in
simple personal gratification; it led to no
noble labor, to no elevating severity of discipline.
Englishman though he was, he filled
his Oriental tower with masterpieces from
Italy and Holland, only to add form and color
to the luxuries of his reverie, behind his gilded
lattices.</p>

<p>And when he raised that other tower at
Fonthill, and the slaves of the lamp toiled at
it by torchlight to gratify his Oriental impatience,
he exercised no influence upon the confusion
of his epoch more durable than that
hundred yards of masonry which sank into a
shapeless heap whilst as yet Azrael spared its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
author. He to whom Nature and Fortune
had been so prodigal of their gifts, he whom
Reynolds painted and Mozart instructed, who
knew the poets of seven literatures, culling
their jewels like flowers in seven enchanted
gardens&mdash;he to whom the palaces of knowledge
all opened their golden gates even in his
earliest youth, to whom were also given riches
and length of days, for whom a thousand
craftsmen toiled in Europe and a thousand
slaves beyond the sea,<a name="FnAnchor_4" id="FnAnchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>&mdash;what has this gifted
mortal left as the testimony of his power, as
the trace of his fourscore years upon the earth?
Only the reminiscence of a vague splendor,
like the fast-fading recollection of a cloud
that burned at sunset, and one small gem of
intellectual creation that lives like a tiny star.</p>

<p>If wealth had only pleasure to offer as a
temptation from intellectual labor, its influence
would be easier to resist. Men of the
English race are often grandly strong in resistance
to every form of voluptuousness; the race
is fond of comfort and convenience, but it does
not sacrifice its energy to enervating self-indulgence.
There is, however, another order
of temptations in great wealth, to which Englishmen
not only yield, but yield with a satisfied
conscience, even with a sense of obedience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
to duty. Wealth carries pleasure in her left
hand, but in her right she bears honor and
power. The rich man feels that he can do so
much by the mere exercise of his command
over the labor of others, and so little by any
unaided labor of his own, that he is always
strongly tempted to become, not only physically
but intellectually, a director of work
rather that a workman. Even his modesty,
when he is modest, tends to foster his reliance
on others rather than himself. All that he
tries to do is done so much better by those
who make it their profession, that he is always
tempted to fall back upon his paying
power as his most satisfactory and effective
force. There are cases in which this temptation
is gloriously overcome, where men of
great wealth compel every one to acknowledge
that their money is nothing more than a help
to their higher life, like the charger that bore
Wellington at Waterloo, serving him indeed
usefully, but not detracting from the honor
which is his due. But in these cases the life
is usually active or administrative rather than
intellectual. The rich man does not generally
feel tempted to enter upon careers in which
his command over labor is not an evident advantage,
and this because men naturally seek
those fields in which <i>all</i> their superiorities
tell. Even the well known instance of Lord
Rosse can scarcely be considered an exception
to this rule, for although he was eminent in a
science which has been followed by poor men
with great distinction, his wealth was of use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
in the construction of his colossal telescope,
which gave him a clear advantage over
merely professional contemporaries.</p>

<p>Besides this natural desire to pursue careers
in which their money may lessen the number
of competitors, the rich are often diverted
from purely intellectual pursuits by the social
duties of their station, duties which it is impossible
to avoid and difficult to keep within
limits. The Duchess of Orleans (mother of
the present Count of Paris) arranged her time
with the greatest care so as to reserve a little of
it for her own culture in uninterrupted solitude.
By an exact system, and the exercise
of the rarest firmness, she contrived to steal
half an hour here and an hour there&mdash;enough
no doubt, when employed as she employed
them, to maintain her character as a very distinguished
lady, yet still far from sufficient
for the satisfactory pursuit of any great art
or science. If it be difficult for the rich man
to enter into the kingdom of heaven, it is also
difficult for him to secure that freedom from
interruption which is necessary to fit him for
his entrance into the Intellectual Kingdom.
He can scarcely allow himself to be absorbed
in any great study, when he reflects on all the
powerful means of social influence which he
is suffering to lie idle. He is sure to possess
by inheritance, or to have acquired in obedience
to custom, a complicated and expensive
machinery for the pleasures and purposes of
society. There is game to be shot; there are
hunters to be exercised; great houses to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
filled with guests. So much is expected of the
rich man, both in business and in pleasure,
that his time is not his own, and he could not
quit his station if he would. And yet the Intellectual
Life, in its fruitful perfection, requires,
I do not say the complete abandonment
of the world, but it assuredly requires
free and frequent spaces of labor in tranquil
solitude, &ldquo;retreats&rdquo; like those commanded by
the Church of Rome, but with more of study
and less of contemplation.</p>

<p>It would be useless to ask you to abdicate
your power, and retreat into some hermitage
with a library and a laboratory, without a
thought of returning to your pleasant hall in
Yorkshire and your house in Mayfair. You
will not sell all and follow the Light, but
there is a life which you may powerfully encourage,
yet only partially share. Notwithstanding
the increased facilities for earning
a living which this age offers to the intellectual,
the time that they are often compelled to
give to the satisfaction of common material
necessities is so much time withdrawn from
the work which they alone can do. It is a lamentable
waste of the highest and rarest kind
of energy to compel minds that are capable of
original investigation, of discovery, to occupy
themselves in that mere vulgarization of
knowledge, in popular lecturing and literature,
which could be done just as efficiently
by minds of a common order. It is an error
of the present age to believe that the time for
what is called patronage is altogether passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
away. Let me mention two instances to the
contrary: one in which kindly help would
have saved fifteen years of a noble life;
another in which that kindly help did actually
permit a man of exceptional endowment
and equally exceptional industry to pursue
investigations for which no other human being
was so well qualified, and which were entirely
incompatible with the earning of the
daily bread. Dr. Carpenter has lately told us
that, finding it impossible to unite the work of
a general practitioner with the scientific researches
upon which his heart was set, he
gave up nine-tenths of his time for twenty
years to popular lecturing and writing, in order
that he might exist and devote the other
tenth to science. &ldquo;Just as he was breaking
down from the excessive strain upon mind
and body which this life involved, an appointment
was offered to Dr. Carpenter which gave
him competence and sufficient leisure for the
investigations which he has conducted to such
important issues.&rdquo; Suppose that during those
twenty years of struggle he <i>had</i> broken down
like many another only a little less robust&mdash;what
then? A mind lost to his country and
the world. And would it not have been happier
for him and for us if some of those men
(of whom there are more in England than in
any other land), who are so wealthy that
their gold is positively a burden and an encumbrance,
like too many coats in summer,
had helped Dr. Carpenter at least a few years
earlier, in some form that a man of high feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
might honorably accept? The other example
that I shall mention is that of Franz
W&oelig;pke, the mathematician and orientalist.
A modest pension, supplied by an Italian
prince who was interested in the history of
mathematics, gave W&oelig;pke that peace which
is incompatible with poverty, and enabled
him to live grandly in his narrow lodging the
noble intellectual life. Was not this rightly
and well done, and probably a much more effectual
employment of the power of gold than
if that Italian prince had added some rare
manuscripts to his own library without having
time or knowledge to decipher them? I
cannot but think that the rich may serve the
cause of culture best by a judicious exercise of
patronage&mdash;unless, indeed, they have within
themselves the sense of that irresistible vocation
which made Humboldt use his fortune
as the servant of his high ambition. The
Humboldts never are too rich; they possess
their gold and are not possessed by it, and
they are exempt from the duty of aiding
others because they themselves have a use
for all their powers.</p>

experiments on public taste&mdash;<i>Surtout ne pas trop écrire</i>&mdash;Auguste
Comte&mdash;The reaction of the intellectual against
money-making&mdash;Money the protector of the intellectual
life.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> been anxious for you lately, and venture
to write to you about the reasons for this
anxiety.</p>

<p>You are neither extravagant nor self-indulgent,
yet it seems to me that your entire absorption
in the higher intellectual pursuits
has produced in you, as it frequently does, a
carelessness about material interests of all
kinds which is by far the most dangerous of
all tempers to the pecuniary well-being of a
man. Sydney Smith declared that no fortune
could stand that temper long, and that we are
on the high road to ruin the moment we think
ourselves rich enough to be careless.</p>

<p>Let me observe, to begin with, that although
the pursuit of wealth is not favorable to the
intellectual life, the inconveniences of poverty
are even less favorable to it. We are sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
lectured on the great benefits of necessity
as a stimulant to exertion, and it is implied
that comfortable people would go much
farther on the road to distinction if they were
made uncomfortable by having to think perpetually
about money. Those who say this
confound together the industry of the industrial
and professional classes, and the labors
of the more purely intellectual. It is clear
that when the labor a man does is of such a
nature that he will be paid for it in strict proportion
to the time and effort he bestows, the
need of money will be a direct stimulus to the
best exertion he may be capable of. In all
simple industrial occupations the need of
money <i>does</i> drive a man forwards, and is
often, when he feels it in early life, the very
origin and foundation of his fortune. There
exists, in such occupations, a perfect harmony
between the present necessity and the ultimate
purpose of the life. Wealth is the object
of industry, and the first steps towards
the possession of it are steps on the chosen
path. The future captain of industry, who
will employ thousands of workpeople and accumulate
millions of money, is going straight
to his splendid future when he gets up at five
in the morning to work in another person&rsquo;s
factory. To learn to be a builder of steam-vessels,
it is necessary, even when you begin
with capital, to pass through the manual
trades, and you will only learn them the better
if the wages are necessary to your existence.
Poverty in these cases only makes an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
intelligent man ground himself all the better
in that stern practical training which is the
basis of his future career. Well, therefore,
may those who have reached distinguished
success in fields of practical activity extol the
teachings of adversity. If it is a necessary
part of your education that you should hammer
rivets inside a steam-boiler, it is as well
that your early habits should not be over-dainty.
So it is observed that horny hands,
in the colonies, get gold into them sooner
than white ones.</p>

<p>Even in the liberal professions young men
get on all the better for not being too comfortably
off. If you have a comfortable private
income to begin with, the meagre early rewards
of professional life will seem too paltry
to be worth hard striving, and so you will
very likely miss the more ample rewards of
maturity, since the common road to success
is nothing but a gradual increase. And you
miss education at the same time, for practice
is the best of professional educators, and
many successful lawyers and artists have
had scarcely any other training. The daily
habit of affairs trains men for the active
business of the world, and if the purpose of
their lives is merely to do what they are doing
or to command others to do the same
things, the more closely circumstances tie
them down to their work, the better.</p>

<p>But in the higher intellectual pursuits the
necessity for immediate earning has an entirely
different result. It comes, not as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
educator, but as an interruption or suspension
of education. All intellectual lives, however
much they may differ in the variety of their
purposes, have at least this purpose in common,
that they are mainly devoted to self-education
of one kind or another. An intellectual
man who is forty years old is as much
at school as an Etonian of fourteen, and if
you set him to earn more money than that
which comes to him without especial care
about it, you interrupt his schooling, exactly
as selfish parents used to do when they sent
their young children to the factory and prevented
them from learning to read. The idea
of the intellectual life is an existence passed
almost entirely in study, yet preserving the
results of its investigations. A day&rsquo;s writing
will usually suffice to record the outcome of
a month&rsquo;s research.</p>

<p>Necessity, instead of advancing your studies,
stops them. Whenever her harsh voice
speaks it becomes your duty to shut your
books, put aside your instruments, and do
something that will fetch a price in the market.
The man of science has to abandon the
pursuit of a discovery to go and deliver a
popular lecture a hundred miles off, for
which he gets five pounds and his railway
fare. The student of ancient literature has
to read some feeble novel, and give three days
of a valuable life to write an anonymous review
which will bring him two pounds ten. The
artist has to leave his serious picture to manufacture
&ldquo;pot-boilers,&rdquo; which will teach him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
nothing, but only spoil his hands and vitiate
the public taste. The poet suspends his poem
(which is promised to a publisher for Christmas,
and will be spoiled in consequence by
hurry at the last) in order to write newspaper
articles on subjects of which he has little
knowledge and in which he takes no interest.
And yet these are instances of those comparatively
happy and fortunate needy who are
only compelled to suspend their intellectual
life, and who can cheer themselves in their
enforced labor with the hope of shortly renewing
it. What of those others who are
pushed out of their path forever by the buffets
of unkindly fortune? Many a fine intellect
has been driven into the deep quagmire,
and has struggled in it vainly till death came,
which but for that grim necessity might have
scaled the immortal mountains.</p>

<p>This metaphor of the mountains has led me,
by a natural association of ideas, to think of
a writer who has added to our enjoyment of
their beauty, and I think of him the more
readily that his career will serve as an illustration&mdash;far
better than any imaginary career&mdash;of
the very subject which just now occupies
my mind. Mr. Ruskin is not only one
of the best instances, but he is positively the
very best instance except the two Humboldts,
of an intellectual career which has
been greatly aided by material prosperity,
and which would not have been possible without
it. This does not in the least detract
from the merit of the author of &ldquo;Modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
Painters,&rdquo; for it needed a rare force of resolution,
or a powerful instinct of genius, to lead
the life of a severe student under every temptation
to indolence. Still it is true that Mr.
Ruskin&rsquo;s career would have been impossible
for a poor man, however gifted. A poor
man would not have had access to Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s
materials, and one of his chief superiorities
has always been an abundant wealth of
material. And if we go so far as to suppose
that the poor man might have found other
materials perhaps equivalent to these, we
know that he could not have turned them to
that noble use. The poor critic would be immediately
absorbed in the ocean of anonymous
periodical literature; he could not find
time for the incubation of great works.
&ldquo;Modern Painters,&rdquo; the result of seventeen
years of study, is not simply a work of genius
but of genius seconded by wealth. Close
to it on my shelves stand four volumes which
are the monument of another intellectual life
devoted to the investigation of nature. De
Saussure, whom Mr. Ruskin reverences as
one of his ablest teachers, and whom all sincere
students of nature regard as a model
observer, pursued for many laborious years a
kind of life which was not, and could not be,
self-supporting in the pecuniary sense. Many
other patient laborers, who have not the celebrity
of these, work steadily in the same way,
and are enabled to do so by the possession of
independent fortune. I know one such who
gives a whole summer to the examination of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
three or four acres of mountain-ground, the
tangible result being comprised in a few memoranda,
which, considered as literary material,
might (in the hands of a skilled professional
writer) just possibly be worth five
pounds.</p>

<p>Not only do narrow pecuniary means often
render high intellectual enterprises absolutely
impossible, but they do what is frequently
even more trying to the health and character,
they permit you to undertake work that
would be worthy of you if you might only
have time and materials for the execution of
it, and then spoil it in the doing. An intellectual
laborer will bear anything except
that. You may take away the very table he
is writing upon, if you let him have a deal
board for his books and papers; you may
take away all his fine editions, if you leave
him common copies that are legible; you
may remove his very candlestick, if you
leave him a bottle-neck to stick his candle in,
and he will go on working cheerfully still.
But the moment you do anything to spoil the
quality of the work itself, you make him irritable
and miserable. &ldquo;You think,&rdquo; says Sir
Arthur Helps, &ldquo;to gain a good man to manage
your affairs because he happens to have
a small share in your undertaking. It is a
great error. You want him to do something
well which you are going to tell him to do.
If he has been wisely chosen, and is an able
man, his pecuniary interest in the matter will
be mere dust in the balance, when compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
with the desire which belongs to all such men
to do their work well.&rdquo; Yes, this is the central
passion of all men of true ability, <i>to do
their work well</i>; their happiness lies in that,
and not in the amount of their profits, or
even in their reputation. But then, on the
other hand, they suffer indescribable mental
misery when circumstances compel them to
do their work less well than they know that,
under more favorable circumstances, they
would be capable of doing it. The want of
money is, in the higher intellectual pursuits,
the most common hindrance to thoroughness
and excellence of work. De Sénancour, who,
in consequence of a strange concatenation of
misfortunes, was all his life struggling in
shallows, suffered not from the privations
themselves, but from the vague feeling that
they stunted his intellectual growth; and
any experienced student of human nature
must be aware that De Sénancour was right.
With larger means he would have seen more
of the world, and known it better, and written
of it with riper wisdom. He said that
the man &ldquo;who only saw in poverty the direct
effect of the money-privation, and only compared,
for instance, an eight-penny dinner to
one that cost ten shillings, would have no
conception of the true nature of misfortune,
for not to spend money is the least of the
evils of poverty.&rdquo; Bossuet said that he &ldquo;had
no attachment to riches, and still if he had
only what is barely necessary, if he felt himself
narrowed, he would lose more than half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
his talents.&rdquo; Sainte-Beuve said, &ldquo;Only think a
little what a difference there is in the starting
point and in the employment of the faculties
between a Duc de Luynes and a Sénancour.&rdquo;
How many of the most distinguished authors
have been dependent upon private means,
not simply for physical sustenance, but for
the opportunities which they afforded of gaining
that experience of life which was absolutely
essential to the full growth of their
mental faculties. Shelley&rsquo;s writings brought
him no profit whatever, and without a private
income he could not have produced them, for
he had not a hundred buyers. Yet his <i>whole
time</i> was employed in study or in travel,
which for him was study of another kind, or
else in the actual labor of composition.
Wordsworth tried to become a London journalist
and failed. A young man called Raisley
Calvert died and left him 900<i>l.</i>; this saved
the poet in Wordsworth, as it kept him till
the publication of the &ldquo;Lyrical Ballads,&rdquo; and
afterwards other pieces of good luck happened
to him, so that he could think and compose at
leisure. Scott would not venture to devote
himself to literature until he had first secured
a comfortable income outside of it.
Poor Kepler struggled with constant anxieties,
and told fortunes by astrology for a
livelihood, saying that astrology as the
daughter of astronomy ought to keep her
mother; but fancy a man of science wasting
precious time over horoscopes! &ldquo;I supplicate
you,&rdquo; he writes to M&oelig;stlin, &ldquo;if there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
a situation vacant at Tübingen, do what you
can to obtain it for me, and let me know the
prices of bread and wine and other necessaries
of life, for my wife is not accustomed to
live on beans.&rdquo; He had to accept all sorts
of jobs; he made almanacs, and served any
one who would pay him. His only tranquil
time for study was when he lived in Styria,
on his wife&rsquo;s income, a tranquillity that did
not last for long, and never returned. How
different is this from the princely ease of Tycho
Brahe, who labored for science alone,
with all the help that the ingenuity of his
age could furnish! There is the same contrast,
in a later generation, between Schiller
and Goethe. Poor Schiller &ldquo;wasting so much
of his precious life in literary hack-work,
translating French books for a miserable pittance;&rdquo;
Goethe, fortunate in his pecuniary
independence as in all the other great circumstances
of his life, and this at a time when
the pay of authors was so miserable that they
could hardly exist by the pen. Schiller got a
shilling a page for his translations. Merck
the publisher offered three pounds sterling
for a drama of Goethe. &ldquo;If Europe praised
me,&rdquo; Goethe said, &ldquo;what has Europe done for
me? Nothing. <i>Even my works have been an
expense to me.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pecuniary rewards which men receive
for their labor are so absurdly (yet inevitably)
disproportionate to the intellectual power that
is needed for the task, and also to the toil involved,
that no one can safely rely upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
higher intellectual pursuits as a protection
from money-anxieties. I will give you two
instances of this disproportion, real instances,
of men who are known to me personally.
One of them is an eminent Englishman of
most remarkable intellectual force, who for
many years past has occupied his leisure in
the composition of works that are valued by
the thinking public to a degree which it would
be difficult to exaggerate. But this thinking
public is not numerous, and so in the year
1866 this eminent philosopher, &ldquo;unable to
continue losing money in endeavoring to enlighten
his contemporaries, was compelled to
announce the termination of his series.&rdquo; On
the other hand, a Frenchman, also known to
me personally, one day conceived the fortunate
idea that a new primer might possibly
be a saleable commodity. So he composed a
little primer, beginning with the alphabet, advancing
to a, b, <i>ab</i>; b, a, <i>ba</i>; and even going
so far in history as to affirm that Adam was
the first man and Abraham the father of the
faithful. He had the wisdom to keep the copyright
of this little publication, which employed
(in the easiest of all imaginable literary labor)
the evenings of a single week. It has brought
him in, ever since, a regular income of 120<i>l.</i> a
year, which, so far from showing any signs of
diminution, is positively improving. This success
encouraged the same intelligent gentleman
to compose more literature of the same
order, and he is now the enviable owner of
several other such copyrights, all of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
very valuable; in fact as good properties as
house-leases in London. Here is an author
who, from the pecuniary point of view, was
incomparably more successful than Milton, or
Shelley, or Goethe. If every intellectual man
could shield his higher life by writing primers
for children which should be as good as house-leases,
if the proverb <i>Qui peut le plus peut le
moins</i> were a true proverb, which it is not,
then of course all men of culture would be perfectly
safe, since they all certainly know the
contents of a primer. But you may be able to
write the most learned philosophical treatise
and still not be able to earn your daily
bread.</p>

<p>Consider, too, the lamentable loss of time
which people of high culture incur in making
experiments on public taste, when money becomes
one of their main objects. Whilst they
are writing stories for children, or elementary
educational books which people of far inferior
attainment could probably do much better,
their own self-improvement comes to a standstill.
If it could only be ascertained without
delay what sort of work would bring in the
money they require, then there would be some
chance of apportioning time so as to make reserves
for self-improvement; but when they
have to write a score of volumes merely to ascertain
the humor of the public, there is little
chance of leisure. The life of the professional
author who has no reputation is much less
favorable to high culture than the life of a
tradesman in moderately easy circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
who can reserve an hour or two every day for
some beloved intellectual pursuit.</p>

<p>Sainte-Beuve tells us that during certain
years of his life he had endeavored, and had
been able, so to arrange his existence that it
should have both sweetness and dignity, writing
from time to time what was agreeable,
reading what was both agreeable and serious,
cultivating friendships, throwing much of his
mind into the intimate relations of every day,
giving more to his friends than to the public,
reserving what was most tender and delicate
for the inner life, enjoying with moderation;
such for him was the dream of an intellectual
existence in which things truly precious were
valued according to their worth. And &ldquo;<i>above
all</i>,&rdquo; he said, above all his desire was not to
write too much, &ldquo;<i>surtout ne pas trop écrire</i>.&rdquo;
And then comes the regret for this wise, well-ordered
life enjoyed by him only for a time.
&ldquo;La nécessité depuis m&rsquo;a saisi et m&rsquo;a contraint
de renoncer à ce que je considérais
comme le seul bonheur ou la consolation exquise
du mélancolique et du sage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Auguste Comte lamented in like manner the
evil intellectual consequences of anxieties
about material needs. &ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;more mortal to my mind than the
necessity, pushed to a certain degree, to have
to think each day about a provision for the
next. Happily I think little and rarely about
all that; but whenever this happens to me I
pass through moments of discouragement and
positive despair, which if the influence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
them became habitual <i>would make me renounce
all my labors, all my philosophical
projects, to end my days like an ass</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are a hundred rules for getting rich,
but the instinct of accumulation is worth all
such rules put together. This instinct is rarely
found in combination with high intellectual
gifts, and the reason is evident. To advance
from a hundred pounds to a thousand is not
an intellectual advance, and there is no intellectual
interest in the addition of a cipher at
the bankers&rsquo;. Simply to accumulate money
that you are never to use is, from the intellectual
point of view, as stupid an operation
as can be imagined. We observe, too, that
the great accumulators, the men who are
gifted by nature with the true instinct, are
not usually such persons as we feel any ambition
to become. Their faculties are concentrated
on one point, and that point, as it seems
to us, of infinitely little importance. We cannot
see that it signifies much to the intellectual
well-being of humanity that John Smith
should be worth his million when he dies,
since we know quite well that John Smith&rsquo;s
mind will be just as ill-furnished then as it is
now. In places where much money is made
we easily acquire a positive disgust for it, and
the curate seems the most distinguished gentleman
in the community, with his old black
coat and his seventy pounds a year. We come
to hate money-matters when we find that they
exclude all thoughtful and disinterested conversation,
and we fly to the society of people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
with fixed incomes, not large enough for much
saving, to escape the perpetual talk about investments.
Our happiest hours have been
spent with poor scholars, and artists, and men
of science, whose words remain in the memory
and make us rich indeed. Then we dislike
money because it rules and restrains us,
and because it is unintelligent and seems
hostile, so far as that which is unintelligent
can be hostile. And yet the real truth is that
money is the strong protector of the intellectual
life. The student sits and studies, too
often despising the power that shelters him
from the wintry night, that gives him roof
and walls, and lamp, and books, and fire. For
money is simply the accumulated labor of the
past, guarding our peace as fleets and armies
guard the industry of England, or like some
mighty fortress-wall within which men follow
the most peaceful avocations. The art is to use
money so that it shall be the protector and
not the scatterer of our time, the body-guard
of the sovereign Intellect and Will.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO A STUDENT IN GREAT POVERTY.</h5>

<p class="pro">Poverty really a great obstacle&mdash;Difference between a thousand
rich men and a thousand poor men taken from persons
of average natural gifts&mdash;The Houses of Parliament&mdash;The
English recognize the natural connection between
wealth and culture&mdash;Connection between ignorance and
parsimony in expenditure&mdash;What may be honestly said for
the encouragement of a very poor student.</p>

<p><span class="sc">As</span> it seems to me that to make light of the
difficulties which lie in the path of another is
not to show true sympathy for him, even
though it is done sometimes out of a sort of
awkward kindness and for his encouragement,
I will not begin by pretending that
poverty is not a great obstacle to the perfection
of the intellectual life. It <i>is</i> a great obstacle;
it is one of the very greatest of all
obstacles. Only observe how riches and poverty
operate upon mankind in the mass.
Here and there no doubt a very poor man attains
intellectual distinction when he has exceptional
strength of will, and health enough
to bear a great strain of extra labor that he
imposes upon himself, and natural gifts so
brilliant that he can learn in an hour what
common men learn in a day. But consider
mankind in the mass. Look, for instance, at
our two Houses of Parliament. They are
composed of men taken from the average run
of Englishmen with very little reference to
ability, but almost all of them are rich men;
not one of them is poor, as you are poor;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
not one of them has to contend against the
stern realities of poverty. Then consider the
very high general level of intellectual attainment
which distinguishes those two assemblies,
and ask yourself candidly whether a
thousand men taken from the beggars in the
streets, or even from the far superior class of
our manufacturing operatives, would be
likely to understand, as the two Houses of
Parliament understand, the many complicated
questions of legislation and of policy
which are continually brought before them.
We all know that the poor are too limited in
knowledge and experience, from the want of
the necessary opportunities, and too little
accustomed to exercise their minds in the
tranquil investigations of great questions, to
be competent for the work of Parliament. It
is scarcely necessary to insist upon this fact
to an Englishman, because the English have
always recognized the natural connection between
wealth and culture, and have preferred
to be governed by the rich from the belief
that they are likely to be better informed, and
better situated for intellectual activity of a
disinterested kind, than those members of the
community whose time and thoughts are almost
entirely occupied in winning their daily
bread by the incessant labor of their hands.
And if you go out into the world, if you mix
with men of very different classes, you will
find that in a broad average way (I am not
speaking just now of the exceptions) the
richer classes are much more capable of entering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
into the sort of thinking which may be
called intellectual than those whose money is
less plentiful, and whose opportunities have
therefore been less abundant. Indeed it may
be asserted, roughly and generally, that the
narrowness of men&rsquo;s ideas is in direct proportion
to their parsimony in expenditure. I do
not mean to affirm that all who spend largely
attain large intellectual results, for of course
we know that a man may spend vast sums on
pursuits which do not educate him in anything
worth knowing, but the advantage is
that with habits of free expenditure the germs
of thought are well tilled and watered, whereas
parsimony denies them every external
help. The most spending class in Europe is the
English gentry, it is also the class most strikingly
characterized by a high general average
of information;<a name="FnAnchor_5" id="FnAnchor_5" href="#Footnote_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> the most parsimonious class
in Europe is the French peasantry; it is also
the class most strikingly characterized by ignorance
and intellectual apathy. The English
gentleman has cultivated himself by various
reading and extensive travel, but the
French peasant will not go anywhere except
to the market-town, and could not pardon the
extravagance of buying a book, or a candle
to read it by in the evening. Between these
extremes we have various grades of the middle
classes in which culture usually increases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
very much in proportion to the expenditure.
The rule is not without its exceptions; there
are rich vulgar people who spend a great deal
without improving themselves at all&mdash;who
only, by unlimited self-indulgence, succeed in
making themselves so uncomfortably sensitive
to every bodily inconvenience that they
have no leisure, even in the midst of an unoccupied
life, to think of anything but their
own bellies and their own skins&mdash;people
whose power of attention is so feeble that the
smallest external incident distracts it, and
who remember nothing of their travels but a
catalogue of trivial annoyances. But people
of this kind do not generally belong to families
on whom wealth has had time to produce
its best effects. What I mean is, that a family
which has been for generations in the
habit of spending four thousand a year will
usually be found to have a more cultivated
one than one that has only spent four hundred.</p>

<p>I have come to the recognition of this truth
very reluctantly indeed, not because I dislike
rich people, but merely because they are necessarily
a very small minority, and I should
like every human being to have the best benefits
of culture if it were only possible. The
plain living and high thinking that Wordsworth
so much valued is a cheering ideal, for
most men have to live plainly, and if they
could only think with a certain elevation we
might hope to solve the great problem of human
life, the reconciliation of poverty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
the soul. There certainly is a slow movement
in that direction, and the shortening of
the hours of labor may afford some margin
of leisure; but we who work for culture
every day and all day long, and still feel that
we know very little, and have hardly skill
enough to make any effective use of the little
that we know, can scarcely indulge in very
enthusiastic anticipations of the future culture
of the poor.</p>

<p>Still, there are some things that may be
rationally and truly said to a poor man who
desires culture, and which are not without a
sort of Spartan encouragement. You are restricted
by your poverty, but it is not always
a bad thing to be restricted, even from the
intellectual point of view. The intellectual
powers of well-to-do people are very commonly
made ineffective by the enormous multiplicity
of objects that are presented to their
attention, and which claim from them a sort
of polite notice like the greeting of a great
lady to each of her thousand guests. It requires
the very rarest strength of mind, in a
rich man, to concentrate his attention on anything
there are so many things that he is
expected to make a pretence of knowing; but
nobody expects <i>you</i> to know anything, and
this is an incalculable advantage. I think
that all poor men who have risen to subsequent
distinction have been greatly indebted
to this independence of public opinion as to
what they ought to know. In trying to
satisfy that public opinion by getting up a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
pretence of various sorts of knowledge, which
is only a sham, we sacrifice not only much
precious time, but we blunt our natural interest
in things. That interest you preserve
in all its virgin force, and this force carries a
man far. Then, again, although the opportunities
of rich people are very superior to
yours, they are not altogether so superior as
they seem. There exists a great equalizing
power, the limitation of human energy. A
rich man may sit down to an enormous banquet,
but he can only make a good use of the
little that he is able to digest. So it is with the
splendid intellectual banquet that is spread
before the rich man&rsquo;s eyes. He can only possess
what he has energy to master, and too
frequently the manifest impossibility of
mastering everything produces a feeling of
discouragement that ends in his mastering
nothing. A poor student, especially if he
lives in an out-of-the-way place where there
are no big libraries to bewilder him, may
apply his energy with effect in the study of a
few authors.</p>

<p>I used to believe a great deal more in opportunities
and less in application than I do
now. Time and health are needed, but with
these there are always opportunities. Rich
people have a fancy for spending money very
uselessly on their culture because it seems to
them more valuable when it has been costly;
but the truth is, that by the blessing of good
and cheap literature, intellectual light has
become almost as accessible as daylight. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
have a rich friend who travels more, and
buys more costly things, than I do, but he
does not really learn more or advance farther
in the twelvemonth. If my days are fully
occupied, what has he to set against them?
only other well-occupied days, no more. If
he is getting benefit at St. Petersburg he is
missing the benefit I am getting round my
house, and in it. The sum of the year&rsquo;s benefit
seems to be surprisingly alike in both
cases. So if you are reading a piece of thoroughly
good literature, Baron Rothschild may
possibly be as well occupied as you&mdash;he is
certainly not better occupied. When I open
a noble volume I say to myself, &ldquo;Now the
only Cr&oelig;sus that I envy is he who is reading
a better book than this.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="foot" /><div class="note">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FnAnchor_4"><span class="fn">4</span></a> This sounds like a poetical exaggeration, but it is less
than the bare truth. There were fifteen hundred slaves on
two West Indian estates that Beckford lost in a lawsuit. It
is quite certain, considering his lavish expenditure, that fully
a thousand men must have worked for the maintenance of
his luxury in Europe. So much for his command of labor.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FnAnchor_5"><span class="fn">5</span></a> The reader will please to bear in mind that I am speaking
here of broad effects on great numbers. I do not think that
aristocracy, in its spirit, is quite favorable to the exceptionally
highest intellectual life.</p>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO HAD FIRMLY
RESOLVED NEVER TO WEAR ANYTHING BUT
A GRAY COAT.<a name="FnAnchor_6" id="FnAnchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a></h5>

<p class="pro">Secret enjoyment of rebellion against custom, and of the disabilities
resulting from it&mdash;Penalties imposed by Society
and by Nature out of proportion to the offence&mdash;Instances&mdash;What
we consider penalties not really penalties, but

<p><span class="sc">When</span> I had the pleasure of staying at
your father&rsquo;s house, you told me, rather to my
surprise, that it was impossible for you to go
to balls and dinner-parties because you did
not possess such a thing as a dress-coat. The
reason struck me as being scarcely a valid
one, considering the rather high scale of expenditure
adopted in the paternal mansion.
It seemed clear that the eldest son of a family
which lived after the liberal fashion of Yorkshire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
country gentlemen could afford himself
a dress-coat if he liked. Then I wondered
whether you disliked dress-coats from a belief
that they were unbecoming to your person;
but a very little observation of your
character convinced me that, whatever might
be your weaknesses (for everybody has some
weaknesses), anxiety about personal appearance
was not one of them.</p>

<p>The truth is, that you secretly enjoy this
little piece of disobedience to custom, and all
the disabilities which result from it. This little
rebellion is connected with a larger rebellion,
and it is agreeable to you to demonstrate
the unreasonableness of society by incurring
a very severe penalty for a very trifling offence.
You are always dressed decently, you
offend against no moral rule, you have cultivated
your mind by study and reflection, and
it rather pleases you to think that a young
gentleman so well qualified for society in
everything of real importance should be excluded
from it because he has not purchased
a permission from his tailor.</p>

<p>The penalties imposed by society for the infraction
of very trifling details of custom are
often, as it seems, out of all proportion to the
offence; but so are the penalties of nature.
Only three days before the date of this letter,
an intimate friend of mine was coming home
from a day&rsquo;s shooting. His nephew, a fine
young man in the full enjoyment of existence,
was walking ten paces in advance. A
covey of partridges suddenly cross the road:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
my friend in shouldering his gun touches the
trigger just a second too soon, and kills his
nephew. Now, think of the long years of
mental misery that will be the punishment of
that very trifling piece of carelessness! My
poor friend has passed, in the space of a single
instant, from a joyous life to a life that is permanently
and irremediably saddened. It is
as if he had left the summer sunshine to
enter a gloomy dungeon and begin a perpetual
imprisonment. And for what? For having
touched a trigger, without evil intention,
a little too precipitately. It seems harder
still for the victim, who is sent out of the
world in the bloom of perfect manhood because
his uncle was not quite so cool as he
ought to have been. Again, not far from
where I live, thirty-five men were killed last
week in a coal-pit from an explosion of fire-damp.
One of their number had struck a
lucifer to light his pipe: for doing this in a
place where he ought not to have done it, the
man suffers the penalty of death, and thirty-four
others with him. The fact is simply
that Nature <i>will</i> be obeyed, and makes no attempt
to proportion punishments to offences:
indeed, what in our human way we call punishments
are not punishments, but simple
consequences. So it is with the great social
penalties. Society <i>will be obeyed</i>: if you refuse
obedience, you must take the consequences.
Society has only one law, and that is
custom. Even religion itself is socially powerful
only just so far as it has custom on its side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span> </p>

<p>Nature does not desire that thirty-five men
should be destroyed because one could not resist
the temptation of a pipe; but fire-damp is
highly inflammable, and the explosion is a
simple consequence. Society does not desire
to exclude you because you will not wear evening
dress; but the dress is customary, and
your exclusion is merely a consequence of your
nonconformity. The view of society goes no
farther in this than the artistic conception
(not very delicately artistic, perhaps) that it is
prettier to see men in black coats regularly
placed between ladies round a dinner-table
than men in gray coats or brown coats. The
uniformity of costume appears to represent
uniformity of sentiment and to ensure a sort
of harmony amongst the <i>convives</i>. What society
really cares for is harmony; what it dislikes
is dissent and nonconformity. It wants
peace in the dining-room, peace in the drawing-room,
peace everywhere in its realm of
tranquil pleasure. You come in your shooting-coat,
which was in tune upon the moors,
but is a dissonance amongst ladies in full
dress. Do you not perceive that fustian and
velveteen, which were natural amongst gamekeepers,
are not so natural on gilded chairs
covered with silk, with lace and diamonds at
a distance of three feet? You don&rsquo;t perceive
it? Very well: society does not argue the
point with you, but only excludes you.</p>

<p>It has been said that in the life of every intellectual
man there comes a time when he
questions custom at all points. This seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
be a provision of nature for the reform and
progress of custom itself, which without such
questioning would remain absolutely stationary
and irresistibly despotic. You rebels
against the established custom have your
place in the great work of progressive civilization.
Without you, Western Europe would
have been a second China. It is to the continual
rebellion of such persons as yourself that
we owe whatever progress has been accomplished
since the times of our remotest forefathers.
There have been rebels always, and
the rebels have not been, generally speaking,
the most stupid part of the nation.</p>

<p>But what is the use of wasting this beneficial
power of rebellion on matters too trivial
to be worth attention? Does it hurt your conscience
to appear in a dress-coat? Certainly
not, and you would be as good-looking in it as
you are in your velveteen shooting-jacket
with the pointers on the bronze buttons. Let
us conform in these trivial matters, which nobody
except a tailor ought to consider worth a
moment&rsquo;s attention, in order to reserve our
strength for the protection of intellectual liberty.
Let society arrange your dress for you
(it will save you infinite trouble), but never
permit it to stifle the expression of your
thought. You find it convenient, because you
are timid, to exclude yourself from the world
by refusing to wear its costume; but a bolder
man would let the tailor do his worst, and
then go into the world and courageously defend
there the persons and causes that are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
misunderstood and slanderously misrepresented.
The fables of Spenser are fables only
in form, and a noble knight may at any time
go forth, armed in the panoply of a tail-coat,
a dress waistcoat, and a manly moral courage,
to do battle across the dinner-table and in the
drawing-room for those who have none to defend
them.</p>

<p>It is unphilosophical to set ourselves obstinately
against custom in the mass, for it multiplies
the power of men by settling useless
discussion and clearing the ground for our
best and most prolific activity. The business
of the world could not be carried forward one
day without a most complex code of customs;
and law itself is little more than custom slightly
improved upon by men reflecting together
at their leisure, and reduced to codes and systems.
We ought to think of custom as a most
precious legacy of the past, saving us infinite
perplexity, yet not as an infallible rule. The
most intelligent community would be conservative
in its habits, yet not obstinately conservative,
but willing to hear and adopt the
suggestions of advancing reason. The great
duty of the intellectual class, and its especial
function, is to confirm what is reasonable in
the customs that have been handed down to
us, and so maintain their authority, yet at the
same time to show that custom is not final,
but merely a form suited to the world&rsquo;s convenience.
And whenever you are convinced
that a custom is no longer serviceable, the way
to procure the abolition of it is to lead men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
very gradually away from it, by offering a
substitute at first very slightly different from
what they have been long used to. If the
English had been in the habit of tattooing, the
best way to procure its abolition would have
been to admit that it was quite necessary to
cover the face with elaborate patterns, yet
gently to suggest that these patterns would
be still more elegant if delicately painted in
water-colors. Then you might have gone on
arguing&mdash;still admitting, of course, the absolute
necessity for ornament of some kind&mdash;that
good taste demanded only a moderate
amount of it; and so you would have brought
people gradually to a little flourish on the nose
or forehead, when the most advanced reformers
might have set the example of dispensing
with ornament altogether. Many of our
contemporaries have abandoned shaving in
this gradual way, allowing the whiskers to
encroach imperceptibly, till at last the razor
lay in the dressing-case unused. The abominable
black cylinders that covered our heads
a few years ago were vainly resisted by radicals
in custom, but the moderate reformers
gradually reduced their elevation, and now
they are things of the past.</p>

<p>Though I think we ought to submit to custom
in matters of indifference, and to reform it
gradually, whilst affecting submission in matters
altogether indifferent, still there are other
matters on which the only attitude worthy of
a man is the most bold and open resistance to
its dictates. Custom may have a right to authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
over your wardrobe, but it cannot
have any right to ruin your self-respect. Not
only the virtues most advantageous to well-being,
but also the most contemptible and degrading
vices, have at various periods of the
world&rsquo;s history been sustained by the full authority
of custom. There are places where
forty years ago drunkenness was conformity to
custom, and sobriety an eccentricity. There
are societies, even at the present day, where
licentiousness is the rule of custom, and
chastity the sign of weakness or want of spirit.
There are communities (it cannot be necessary
to name them) in which successful fraud, especially
on a large scale, is respected as the
proof of smartness, whilst a man who remains
poor because he is honest is despised for slowness
and incapacity. There are whole nations
in which religious hypocrisy is strongly approved
by custom, and honesty severely condemned.
The Wahabee Arabs may be mentioned
as an instance of this, but the Wahabee
Arabs are not the only people, nor is Nejed
the only place, where it is held to be more
virtuous to lie on the side of custom than to be
an honorable man in independence of it. In
all communities where vice and hypocrisy are
sustained by the authority of custom, eccentricity
is a moral duty. In all communities
where a low standard of thinking is received
as infallible common sense, eccentricity becomes
an intellectual duty. There are hundreds
of places in the provinces where it is impossible
for any man to lead the intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
life without being condemned as an eccentric.
It is the duty of intellectual men who are thus
isolated to set the example of that which their
neighbors call eccentricity, but which may be
more accurately described as superiority.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> astonishing revolution in thought and
practice which is taking place amongst the
intelligent Japanese, the throwing away of a
traditional system of living in order to establish
in its stead a system which, for an Asiatic
people, is nothing more than a vast experiment,
has its counterpart in many an individual
life in Europe. We are like travellers
crossing an isthmus between two seas,
who have left one ship behind them, who
have not yet seen the vessel that waits on the
distant shore, and who experience to the full
all the discomforts and inconveniences of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
passage from one sea to the other. There is a
break between the existence of our forefathers
and that of our posterity, and it is we who
have the misfortune to be situated exactly
where the break occurs. We are leaving behind
us the security, I do not say the safety,
but the feeling of tranquillity which belonged
to the ages of tradition; we are entering upon
ages whose spirit we foresee but dimly, whose
institutions are the subject of guesses and
conjectures. And yet this future, of which
we know so little, attracts us more by the
very vastness of its enigma than the rich history
of the past, so full of various incident, of
powerful personages, of grandeur, and suffering,
and sorrow. Joubert already noticed
this forward-looking of the modern mind.
&ldquo;The ancients,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;said, &lsquo;Our ancestors;&rsquo;
we say, &lsquo;Posterity.&rsquo; We do not
love as they did <i>la patrie</i>, the country and
laws of our forefathers; we love rather the
laws and the country of our children. It is
the magic of the future, and not that of the
past, which seduces us.&rdquo; Commenting on
this thought of Joubert&rsquo;s, Saint-Marc Girardin
said that we loved the future because we
loved ourselves, and fashioned the future in
our own image; and he added, with partial but
not complete injustice, that our ignorance of
the past was a cause of this tendency in our
minds, since it is shorter to despise the past
than to study it. These critics and accusers
of the modern spirit are not, however, altogether
fair to it. If the modern spirit looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
so much to the future, it is because the problems
of the past are solved problems, whilst
those of the future have the interest of a
game that is only just begun. We know
what became of feudalism, we know the
work that it accomplished and the services
that it rendered, but we do not yet know
what will be the effects of modern democracy
and of the scientific and industrial spirit. It
is the novelty of this element, the scientific
spirit and the industrial development which
is a part (but only a part) of its results, that
makes the past so much less reliable as a
guide than it would have been if no new element
had intervened, and therefore so much
less interesting for us. As an example of the
inapplicability of past experience, I may mention
an argument against Republics which
has been much used of late by the partisans
of monarchy in France. They have frequently
told us that Republics had only succeeded
in very small States, and this is true
of ancient democracies; but it is not less true
that railways, and telegraphs, and the newspaper
press have made great countries like
France and the United States just as capable
of feeling and acting simultaneously as the
smallest Republics of antiquity. The parties
which rely on what are called the lessons of
history are continually exposed to great deceptions.
In France, what may be called the
historical party would not believe in the possibility
of a united Germany, because fifty
years ago, with the imperfect means of communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
which then existed, Germany
was not and could not be united. The same
historical party refused to believe that the
Italian kingdom could ever hold together.
In England, the historical party predicted
the dismemberment of the United States, and
in some other countries it has been a favorite
article of faith that England could not keep
her possessions. But theories of this kind are
always of very doubtful applicability to the
present, and their applicability to the future
is even more doubtful still. Steam and electricity
have made great modern States practically
like so many great cities, so that Manchester
is like a suburb of London, and
Havre the Piræus of Paris, whilst the most
trifling occasions bring the Sovereign of Italy
to any of the Italian capitals.</p>

<p>In the intellectual sphere the experience of
the past is at least equally unreliable. If the
power of the Catholic Church had been suddenly
removed from the Europe of the fourteenth
century, the consequence would have
been a moral anarchy difficult to conceive;
but in our own day the real regulator of morality
is not the Church, but public opinion,
in the formation of which the Church has a
share, but only a share. It would therefore
be unsafe to conclude that the weakening of
ecclesiastical authority must of necessity, in
the future, be followed by moral anarchy,
since it is possible, and even probable, that
the other great influences upon public opinion
may gain strength as this declines. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
in point of fact we have already lived long
enough to witness a remarkable decline of ecclesiastical
authority, which is proved by the
avowed independence of scientific writers and
thinkers, and by the open opposition of almost
all the European Governments. The
secular power resists the ecclesiastical in Germany
and Spain. In France it establishes a
form of government which the Church detests.
In Ireland it disestablishes and disendows
a hierarchy. In Switzerland it resists
the whole power of the Papacy. In Italy it
seizes the sacred territory and plants itself
within the very walls of Rome. And yet the
time which has witnessed this unprecedented
self-assertion of the laity has witnessed a
positive increase in the morality of public
sentiment, especially in the love of justice
and the willingness to hear truth, even when
truth is not altogether agreeable to the listener,
and in the respect paid by opponents to
able and sincere men, merely for their ability
and sincerity. This love of justice, this patient
and tolerant hearing of new truth, in
which our age immeasurably exceeds all the
ages that have preceded it, are the direct results
of the scientific spirit, and are not only
in themselves eminently moral, but conducive
to moral health generally. And this advancement
may be observed in countries
which were least supposed to be capable of
it. Even the French, of whose immorality
we have heard so much, have a public opinion
which is gradually gaining a salutary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
strength, an increasing dislike for barbarity
and injustice, and a more earnest desire that
no citizen, except by his own fault, should be
excluded from the benefits of civilization.
The throne which has lately fallen was undermined
by the currents of this public opinion
before it sank in military disaster. &ldquo;Aussi
me contenterai-je,&rdquo; says Littré, &ldquo;d&rsquo;appeler
l&rsquo;attention sur la guerre, dont l&rsquo;opinion publique
ne tolère plus les antiques barbaries;
sur la magistrature, qui répudie avec horreur
les tortures et la question; sur la tolérance,
qui a banni les persécutions religieuses;
sur l&rsquo;équite, qui soumet tout le monde aux
charges communes; sur le sentiment de solidarité
qui du sort des classes pauvres fait le
plus pressant et le plus noble problème du
temps présent. Pour moi, je ne sais caractériser
ce spectacle si hautement moral qu&rsquo;en
disant que l&rsquo;humanité, améliorée, accepte de
plus en plus le devoir et la tâche d&rsquo;étendre le
domaine de la justice et de la bonté.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet this partial and comparative satisfaction
that we find in the present, and our
larger hopes for the future, are quite compatible
with gratitude to all who in the past
have rendered such improvement possible for
us, and the higher improvement that we hope
for possible to those who will come after us.
I cannot think that the present age may be
accused with justice of exceptional ignorance
or scorn of its predecessors. We have been
told that we scorn our forefathers because old
buildings are removed to suit modern conveniences,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
because the walls of old York have
been pierced for the railway, and a tower of
Conway Castle has been undermined that the
Holyhead mail may pass. But the truth is,
that whilst we care a little for our predecessors,
they cared still less for theirs. The
mediæval builders not only used as quarries
any Roman remains that happened to come
in their way, but they spoiled the work of
their own fathers and grandfathers by intruding
their new fashions on buildings originally
designed in a different style of art.
When an architect in the present day has to
restore some venerable church, he endeavors
to do so in harmony with the design of the
first builder; but such humility as this was
utterly foreign to the mediæval mind, which
often destroyed the most lovely and necessary
details to replace them with erections in
the fashion of the day, but artistically unsuitable.
The same disdain for the labors of
other ages has prevailed until within the
memory of living men, and our age is really
the first that has made any attempt to conform
itself, in these things, to the intentions
of the dead. I may also observe, that although
history is less relied upon as a guide
to the future than it was formerly, it is more
carefully and thoroughly investigated from
an intellectual interest in itself.</p>

<p>To conclude. It seems to me that tradition
has much less influence of an authoritative
kind than it had formerly, and that the authority
which it still possesses is everywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
steadily declining; that as a guide to the future
of the world it is more likely to mislead
than to enlighten us, and still that all intellectual
and educated people must always take
a great interest in tradition, and have a certain
sentiment of respect for it. Consider what
our feelings are towards the Church of Rome,
the living embodiment of tradition. No well-informed
person can forget the immense services
that in former ages she has rendered to
European civilization, and yet at the same
time such a person would scarcely wish to
place modern thought under her direction,
nor would he consult the Pope about the tendencies
of the modern world. When in 1829
the city of Warsaw erected a monument to
Copernicus, a scientific society there waited
in the Church of the Holy Cross for a service
that was to have added solemnity to their
commemoration. They waited vainly. Not
a single priest appeared. The clergy did not
feel authorized to countenance a scientific discovery
which, in a former age, had been condemned
by the authority of the Church.
This incident is delicately and accurately typical
of the relation between the modern and
the traditional spirit. The modern spirit is
not hostile to tradition, and would not object
to receive any consecration which tradition
might be able to confer, but there are difficulties
in bringing the two elements together.</p>

<p>We need not, however, go so far as Warsaw,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
or back to the year 1829, for examples of
an unwillingness on the part of the modern
mind to break entirely with the traditional
spirit. Our own country is remarkable both
for the steadiness of its advance towards a
future widely different from the past, and for
an affectionate respect for the ideas and institutions
that it gradually abandons, as it is
forced out of them by new conditions of existence,
I may mention, as one example out of
very many, our feeling about the reconstruction
of the navy. Here is a matter in which
science has compelled us to break with tradition
absolutely and irrevocably; we have done
so, but we have done so with the greatest regret.
The ships of the line that our hearts
and imaginations love are the ships of Nelson
and Collingwood and Cochrane. We think of
the British fleets that bore down upon the
enemy with the breeze in their white sails;
we think of the fine qualities of seamanship
that were fostered in our <i>Agamemnons</i>, and
<i>Victories</i>, and <i>Téméraires</i>. Will the navies
of the future ever so clothe their dreadful
powers with beauty, as did the ordered columns
of Nelson, when they came with a fair
wind and all sails set, at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
morning into Trafalgar Bay? We see the
smoke of their broadsides rising up to their
sails like mists to the snowy Alps, and high
above, against heaven&rsquo;s blue, the unconquered
flag of England! Nor do we perceive now for
the first time that there was poetry in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
fleets of old; our forefathers felt it then, and
expressed it in a thousand songs.<a name="FnAnchor_7" id="FnAnchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO A LADY WHO LAMENTED THAT HER SON HAD
INTELLECTUAL DOUBTS CONCERNING THE DOGMAS
OF THE CHURCH.</h5>

<p class="pro">The situation of mother and son a very common one&mdash;Painful
only when the parties are in earnest&mdash;The knowledge of
the difference evidence of a deeper unity&mdash;Value of honesty&mdash;Evil
of a splendid official religion not believed by
men of culture&mdash;Diversity of belief an evidence of religious
vitality&mdash;Criticism not to be ignored&mdash;Desire for the
highest attainable truth&mdash;Letter from Lady Westmorland
about her son, Julian Fane.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> difference which you describe as having
arisen between your son and you on the
most grave and important subject which can
occupy the thoughts of men, gives the outline
of a situation painful to both the parties concerned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
and which lays on each of them new
and delicate obligations. You do not know
how common this situation is, and how sadly
it interferes with the happiness of the very
best and most pure-minded souls alive. For
such a situation produces pain only where
both parties are earnest and sincere; and the
more earnest both are, the more painful does
the situation become. If you and your son
thought of religion merely from the conventional
point of view, as the world does only
too easily, you would meet on a common
ground, and might pass through life without
ever becoming aware of any gulf of separation,
even though the hollowness of your several
professions were of widely different
kinds. But as it happens, unfortunately for
your peace (yet would you have it otherwise?),
that you are both in earnest, both
anxious to believe what is true and do what
you believe to be right, you are likely to
cause each other much suffering of a kind
altogether unknown to less honorable and devoted
natures. There are certain forms of
suffering which affect only the tenderest and
truest hearts; they have so many privileges,
that this pain has been imposed upon them
as the shadow of their sunshine.</p>

<p>Let me suggest, as some ground of consolation
and of hope, that your very knowledge
of the difference which pains you is in itself
the evidence of a deeper unity. If your son
has told you the full truth about the changes
in his belief, it is probably because you yourself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
have educated him in the habit of truthfulness,
which is as much a law of religion as
it is of honor. Do you wish this part of his
education to be enfeebled or obliterated?
Could the Church herself reasonably or consistently
blame him for practising the one
virtue which, in a peaceful and luxurious society,
demands a certain exercise of courage?
Our beliefs are independent of our will, but
our honesty is not; and he who keeps his
honesty keeps one of the most precious possessions
of all true Christians and gentlemen.
What state of society can be more repugnant
to high religious feeling than a state of
smooth external unanimity combined with
the indifference of the heart, a state in which
some splendid official religion performs its
daily ceremonies as the costliest functionary
of the Government, whilst the men of culture
take a share in them out of conformity to the
customs of society, without either the assent
of the intellect or the emotion of the soul?
All periods of great religious vitality have
been marked by great and open diversity of
belief; and to this day those countries where
religion is most alive are the farthest removed
from unanimity in the details of religious
doctrine. If your son thinks these things of
such importance to his conscience that he
feels compelled to inflict upon you the slightest
pain on their account, you may rest assured
that his religious fibre is still full of vitality.
If it were deadened, he would argue
very much as follows. He would say:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
&ldquo;These old doctrines of the Church are not
of sufficient consequence for me to disturb
my mother about them. What is the use of
alluding to them ever?&rdquo; And then you
would have no anxiety; and he himself
would have the feeling of settled peace which
comes over a battle-field when the dead are
buried out of sight. It is the peculiarity&mdash;some
would say the evil, but I cannot think
it an evil&mdash;of an age of great intellectual activity
to produce an amount of critical inquiry
into religious doctrine which is entirely
unknown to times of simple tradition.
And in these days the critical tendency has
received a novel stimulus from the successive
suggestions of scientific discovery. No
one who, like your son, fully shares in the intellectual
life of the times in which he lives,
can live as if this criticism did not exist. If
he affected to ignore it, as an objection
already answered, there would be disingenuousness
in the affectation. Fifty years ago,
even twenty or thirty years ago, a highly intellectual
young man might have hardened
into the fixed convictions of middle age without
any external disturbance, except such as
might have been easily avoided. The criticism
existed then, in certain circles; but it
was not in the air, as it is now. The life of
mankind resembles that of a brook which
has its times of tranquillity, but farther on its
times of trouble and unrest. Our immediate
forefathers had the peaceful time for their
lot; those who went before them had passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
over very rough ground at the Reformation.
For us, in our turn, comes the recurrent restlessness,
though not in the same place.
What we are going to, who can tell? What
we suffer just now, you and many others
know too accurately. There are gulfs of separation
in homes of the most perfect love.
Our only hope of preserving what is best in
that purest of earthly felicities lies in the
practice of an immense charity, a wide tolerance,
a sincere respect for opinions that are
not ours, and a deep trust that the loyal pursuit
of truth cannot but be in perfect accordance
with the intentions of the Creator, who
endowed the noblest races of mankind with
the indefatigable curiosity of science. Not
to inquire was possible for our forefathers,
but it is not possible for us. With our intellectual
growth has come an irrepressible
anxiety to possess the highest truth attainable
by us. This desire is not sinful, not
presumptuous, but really one of the best and
purest of our instincts, being nothing else
than the sterling honesty of the intellect,
seeking the harmony of concordant truth,
and utterly disinterested.</p>

<p>I may quote, as an illustration of the tendencies
prevalent amongst the noblest and
most cultivated young men, a letter from
Lady Westmorland to Mr. Robert Lytton
about her accomplished son, the now celebrated
Julian Fane. &ldquo;We had,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;several conversations, during his last illness,
upon religious subjects, about which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
had his own peculiar views. The disputes
and animosities between High and Low
Church, and all the feuds of religious sectarianism,
caused him the deepest disgust. I
think, indeed, that he carried this feeling too
far. He had a horror of <i>cant</i>, which I also
think was exaggerated; for it gave him a repulsion
for all outward show of religious observances.
He often told me that he never
missed the practice of prayer, at morning and
evening, and at other times. But his prayers
were his own: his own thoughts in his own
words. He said that he could not pray in the
set words of another; nor unless he was <i>alone</i>.
As to joining in family prayers, or praying
at church, he found it impossible. He constantly
read the New Testament. He deprecated
the indiscriminate reading of the Bible.
He firmly believed in the efficacy of sincere
prayer; and was always pleased when I told
him I had prayed for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this it may be added, that many recent
conversions to the Church of Rome, though
apparently of an exactly opposite character,
have in reality also been brought about by
the scientific inquiries of the age. The religious
sentiment, alarmed at the prospect of a
possible taking away of that which it feeds
upon, has sought in many instances to preserve
it permanently under the guardianship
of the strongest ecclesiastical authority. In
an age of less intellectual disturbance this
anxiety would scarcely have been felt; and
the degree of authority claimed by one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
reformed Churches would have been accepted
as sufficient. Here again the agitations of the
modern intellect have caused division in families;
and as you are lamenting the heterodoxy
of your son, so other parents regret the
Roman orthodoxy of theirs.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>TO THE SON OF THE LADY TO WHOM THE PRECEDING
LETTER WAS ADDRESSED.</h5>

<p class="pro">Difficulty of detaching intellectual from religious questions&mdash;The
sacerdotal system&mdash;Necessary to ascertain what
religion is&mdash;Intellectual religion really nothing but philosophy&mdash;The
popular instinct&mdash;The test of belief&mdash;Public
worship&mdash;The intellect moral, but not religious&mdash;Intellectual
activity sometimes in contradiction to dogma&mdash;Differences
between the intellectual and religious lives.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Your</span> request is not so simple as it appears.
You ask me for a frank opinion as to the
course your mind is taking in reference to very
important subjects; but you desire only intellectual,
and not religious guidance. The difficulty
is to effect any clear demarcation between
the two. Certainly I should never take
upon myself to offer religious advice to any
one; it is difficult for those who have not qualified
themselves for the priestly office to do
that with force and effect. The manner in
which a priest leads and manages a mind that
has from the first been moulded in the beliefs
and observances of his Church, cannot be imitated
by a layman. A priest starts always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
from authority; his method, which has been
in use from the earliest ages, consists first in
claiming your unquestioning assent to certain
doctrines, from which he immediately proceeds
to deduce the inferences that may affect
your conduct or regulate your thoughts. It
is a method perfectly adapted to its own ends.
It can deal with all humanity, and produce
the most immediate practical results. So long
as the assent to the doctrines is sincere, the
sacerdotal system may contend successfully
against some of the strongest forms of evil;
but when the assent to the doctrines has
ceased to be complete, when some of them are
half-believed and others not believed at all, the
system loses much of its primitive efficiency.
It seems likely that your difficulty, the difficulty
of so many intellectual men in these
days, is to know where the intellectual questions
end and the purely religious ones can be
considered to begin. If you could once ascertain
that, in a manner definitely satisfactory,
you would take your religious questions to a
clergyman and your intellectual ones to a
man of science, and so get each solved independently.</p>

<p>Without presuming to offer a solution of so
complex a difficulty as this, I may suggest to
you that it is of some importance to your intellectual
life to ascertain what religion is. A
book was published many years ago by a very
learned author, in which he endeavored to
show that what is vulgarly called scepticism
may be intellectual religion. Now, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
nothing can be more distasteful to persons of
culture than the bigotry which refuses the
name of religion to other people&rsquo;s opinions,
merely because they are other people&rsquo;s opinions,
I suspect that the popular instinct is
right in denying the name of religion to the
inferences of the intellect. The description
which the author just alluded to gave of what
he called intellectual religion was in fact
simply a description of philosophy, and of
that discipline which the best philosophy imposes
upon the heart and the passions. On
the other hand, Dr. Arnold, when he says
that by religion he always understands Christianity,
narrows the word as much as he
would have narrowed the word &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo;
had he defined it to mean a devotion to the
interests of England. I think the popular instinct,
though of course quite unable to construct
a definition of religion, is in its vague
way very well aware of the peculiar nature of
religious thought and feeling. The popular
instinct would certainly never confound religion
with philosophy on the one hand, nor, on
the other, unless excited to opposition, would
it be likely to refuse the name of religion to
another worship, such as Mahometanism, for
instance.</p>

<p>According to the popular instinct, then,
which on a subject of this kind appears the
safest of all guides, a religion involves first a
belief and next a public practice. The nature
of the belief is in these days wholly peculiar
to religion; in other times it was not so, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
then people believed other things much
in the same way. But in these days the test
of religious belief is that it should make men
accept as certain truth what they would disbelieve
on any other authority. For example,
a true Roman Catholic believes that the consecrated
host is the body of Christ, and so
long as he lives in the purely religious spirit
he continues to believe this; but so soon as
the power of his religious sentiment declines
he ceases to believe it, and the wafer appears
to him a wafer, and no more. And so
amongst Protestants the truly religious believe
many things which no person not being
under the authority of religion could by any
effort bring himself to believe. It is easy, for
example, to believe that Joshua arrested the
sun&rsquo;s apparent motion, so long as the religious
authority of the Bible remains perfectly intact;
but no sooner does the reader become
critical than the miracle is disbelieved. In
all ages, and in all countries, religions have
narrated marvellous things, and the people
have always affirmed that not to believe these
narratives constituted the absence of religion,
or what they called atheism. They have
equally, in all ages and countries, held the
public act of participation in religious worship
to be an essential part of what they called religion.
They do not admit the sufficiency of
secret prayer.</p>

<p>Can these popular instincts help us to a definition?
They may help us at least to mark
the dividing line between religion and morality,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
between religion and philosophy. No one
has ever desired, more earnestly and eagerly
than I, to discover the foundations of the intellectual
religion; no one has ever felt more
chilling disappointment in the perception of
the plain bare fact that the intellect gives
morality, philosophy, precious things indeed,
but not religion. It is like seeking art by
science. Thousands of artists, whole schools
from generation to generation, have sought
fine art through anatomy and perspective;
and although these sciences did not hinder
the born artists from coming to art at last,
they did not ensure their safe arrival in the
art-paradise; in many instances they even led
men away from art. So it is with the great
modern search for the intellectual religion;
the idea of it is scientific in its source, and the
result of it, the last definite attainment, is
simply intellectual morality, not religion in
the sense which all humanity has attached to
religion during all the ages that have preceded
ours. We may say that philosophy is the religion
of the intellectual; and if we go scrupulously
to Latin derivations, it is so. But
taking frankly the received meaning of the
word as it is used by mankind everywhere,
we must admit that, although high intellect
would lead us inevitably to high and pure
morality, and to most scrupulously beautiful
conduct in everything, towards men, towards
women, towards even the lower and lowest
animals, still it does not lead us to that belief
in the otherwise unbelievable, or to that detailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
<i>cultus</i> which is meant by religion in the
universally accepted sense. It is disingenuous
to take a word popularly respected and
attribute to it another sense. Such a course
is not strictly honest, and therefore not purely
intellectual; for the foundation of the intellectual
life is honesty.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the intellectual life is, that
whilst it can never assume a position of hostility
to religion, which it must always recognize
as the greatest natural force for the amelioration
of mankind, it is nevertheless compelled
to enunciate truths which may happen
to be in contradiction with dogmas received
at this or that particular time. That you
may not suspect me of a disposition to dwell
continually on safe generalities and to avoid
details out of timidity, let me mention two
cases on which the intellectual and scientific
find themselves at variance with the clergy.
The clergy tell us that mankind descend from
a single pair, and that in the earlier ages the
human race attained a longevity counted not
by decades but by centuries. Alexander
Humboldt disbelieves the first of these propositions,
Professor Owen disbelieves the second.
Men of science generally are of the
same opinion. Few men of science accept
Adam and Eve, few accept Methuselah. Professor
Owen argues that, since the oldest
skeletons known have the same system of
teething that we have, man can never have
lived long enough to require nine sets of
teeth. In regard to these, and a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
other points on which science advances new
views, the question which concerns us is how
we are to maintain the integrity of the intellectual
life. The danger is the loss of inward
ingenuousness, the attempt to persuade ourselves
that we believe opposite statements.
If once we admit disingenuousness into the
mind, the intellectual life is no longer serene
and pure. The plain course for the preservation
of our honesty, which is the basis of
truly intellectual thinking, is to receive the
truth, whether agreeable or the contrary,
with all its train of consequences, however
repulsive or discouraging. In attempting to
reconcile scientific truth with the oldest traditions
of humanity, there is but one serious
danger, the loss of intellectual integrity. Of
that possession modern society has little left
to lose.</p>

<p>But let us understand that the intellectual
life and the religious life are as distinct as the
scientific and the artistic lives. They may
be led by the same person, but by the same
person in different moods. They coincide on
some points, accidentally. Certainly, the
basis of high thinking is perfect honesty, and
honesty is a recognized religious virtue.
Where the two minds differ is on the importance
of authority. The religious life is
based upon authority, the intellectual life is
based upon personal investigation. From the
intellectual point of view I cannot advise
you to restrain the spirit of investigation,
which is the scientific spirit. It may lead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
you very far, yet always to truth, ultimately,&mdash;you,
or those after you, whose path you
may be destined to prepare. Science requires
a certain inward heat and heroism in her votaries,
notwithstanding the apparent coldness
of her statements. Especially does she require
that intellectual fearlessness which accepts
a proved fact without reference to its
personal or its social consequences.</p>

<h3>LETTER V.</h3>

<h5>TO A FRIEND WHO SEEMED TO TAKE CREDIT TO
HIMSELF, INTELLECTUALLY, FROM THE NATURE
OF HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEF.</h5>

<p class="pro">Anecdote of a Swiss gentleman&mdash;Religious belief protects traditions,
but does not weaken the critical faculty itself&mdash;Illustration
from the art of etching&mdash;Sydney Smith&mdash;Dr.
Arnold&mdash;Earnest religious belief of Ampère&mdash;Comte and
Sainte-Beuve&mdash;Faraday&mdash;Belief or unbelief proves nothing
for or against intellectual capacity.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I happened</span> once to be travelling in Switzerland
with an eminent citizen of that country,
and I remember how in speaking of some
place we passed through he associated together
the ideas of Protestantism and intellectual
superiority in some such phrase as
this: &ldquo;The people here are very superior;
they are Protestants.&rdquo; There seemed to exist,
in my companion&rsquo;s mind, an assumption
that Protestants would be superior people intellectually,
or that superior people would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
Protestants; and this set me thinking whether,
in the course of such experience as had fallen
in my way, I had found that religious creed
had made much difference in the matter of
intellectual acumen or culture.</p>

<p>The exact truth appears to be this. A religious
belief protects this or that subject
against intellectual action, but it does not
affect the energy of the intellectual action upon
subjects which are not so protected. Let
me illustrate this by a reference to one of the
fine arts, the art of etching. The etcher protects
a copper-plate by means of a waxy covering
called etching-ground, and wherever this
ground is removed the acid bites the copper.
The waxy ground does not in the least affect
the strength of the acid, it only intervenes
between it and the metal plate. So it is in the
mind of man with regard to his intellectual
acumen and his religious creed. The creed
may protect a tradition from the operation of
the critical faculty, but it does not weaken
the critical faculty itself. In the English
Church, for example, the Bible is protected
against criticism; but this does not weaken
the critical faculty of English clergymen
with reference to other literature, and many
of them give evidence of a strong critical
faculty in all matters not protected by their
creed. Think of the vigorous common sense
of Sydney Smith, exposing so many abuses at
a time when it needed not only much courage
but great originality to expose them! Remember
the intellectual force of Arnold, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
great natural force if ever there was one&mdash;so
direct in action, so independent of contemporary
opinion! Intellectual forces of this
kind act freely not only in the Church of
England, but in other Churches, even in the
Church of Rome. Who amongst the scientific
men of this century has been more profoundly
scientific, more capable of original
scientific discovery than Ampère? Yet Ampère
was a Roman Catholic, and not a Roman
Catholic in the conventional sense
merely, like the majority of educated Frenchmen,
but a hearty and enthusiastic believer
in the doctrines of the Church of Rome.
The belief in transubstantiation did not prevent
Ampère from becoming one of the best
chemists of his time, just as the belief in the
plenary inspiration of the New Testament
does not prevent a good Protestant from becoming
an acute critic of Greek literature
generally. A man may have the finest scientific
faculty, the most advanced scientific
culture, and still believe the consecrated wafer
to the body of Jesus Christ. For since
he still believes it to be the body of Christ under
the apparent form of a wafer, it is evident
that the wafer under chemical analysis would
resolve itself into the same elements as before
consecration; therefore why consult chemistry?
What has chemistry to say to a mystery
of this kind, the essence of which is the
<i>complete</i> disguise of a human body under a
form in <i>all</i> respects answering the material
semblance of a wafer? Ampère must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
foreseen the certain results of analysis as
clearly as the best chemist educated in the
principles of Protestantism, but this did not
prevent him from adoring the consecrated
host in all the sincerity of his heart.</p>

<p>I say that it does not follow, because M. or
N. happens to be a Protestant, that he is intellectually
superior to Ampère, or because
M. or N. happens to be a Unitarian, or a Deist,
or a Positivist, that he is intellectually superior
to Dr. Arnold or Sydney Smith. And on
the other side of this question it is equally
unfair to conclude that because a man does
not share whatever may be our theological
beliefs on the positive side, he must be less
capable intellectually than we are. Two of
the finest and most disciplined modern intellects,
Comte and Sainte-Beuve, were neither
Catholics, nor Protestants, nor Deists, but
convinced atheists; yet Comte until the period
of his decline, and Sainte-Beuve up to the
very hour of his death, were quite in the
highest rank of modern scientific and literary
intellect.</p>

<p>The inference from these facts which concerns
every one of us is, that we are not to
build up any edifice of intellectual self-satisfaction
on the ground that in theological
matters we believe or disbelieve this thing or
that. If Ampère believed the doctrines of
the Church of Rome, which to us seem so incredible,
if Faraday remained throughout his
brilliant intellectual career (certainly one of
the most brilliant ever lived through by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
human being) a sincere member of the obscure
sect of the Sandemanians, we are not
warranted in the conclusion that we are intellectually
their betters because our theology
is more novel, or more fashionable, or more
in harmony with reason. Nor, on the other
hand, does our orthodoxy prove anything in
favor of our mental force and culture. Who,
amongst the most orthodox writers, has a
more forcible and cultivated intellect than
Sainte-Beuve?&mdash;who can better give us the
tone of perfect culture, with its love of justice,
its thoroughness in preparation, its superiority
to all crudeness and violence? Anglican
or Romanist, dissenter or heretic, may
be our master in the intellectual sphere, from
which no sincere and capable laborer is excluded,
either by his belief or by his unbelief.</p>

<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>

<h5>TO A ROMAN CATHOLIC FRIEND WHO ACCUSED
THE INTELLECTUAL CLASS OF A WANT OF
REVERENCE FOR AUTHORITY.</h5>

<p class="pro">Necessity for treating affirmations as if they were doubtful&mdash;The
Papal Infallibility&mdash;The Infallibility of the Sacred
Scriptures&mdash;Opposition of method between Intellect and
Faith&mdash;The perfection of the intellectual life requires intellectual
methods&mdash;Inevitable action of the intellectual
forces.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is very much the custom, in modern
writing about liberty of thought, to pass
lightly over the central difficulty, which
sooner or later will have to be considered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
The difficulty is this, that the freedom of the
intellectual life can never be secured except
by treating as if they were doubtful several
affirmations which large masses of mankind
hold to be certainties as indisputable as the
facts of science. One of the most recently
conspicuous of these affirmations is the infallibility
of the Pope of Rome. Nothing can
be more certain in the opinion of immense
numbers of Roman Catholics than the infallible
authority of the Supreme Pontiff on all
matters affecting doctrine. But then the
matters affecting doctrine include many subjects
which come within the circle of the
sciences. History is one of those subjects
which modern intellectual criticism takes
leave to study after its own methods, and yet
certain prevalent views of history are offensive
to the Pope and explicitly condemned by
him. The consequence is, that in order to
study history with mental liberty, we have
to act practically as if there existed a doubt
of the Papal infallibility. The same difficulty
occurs with reference to the great Protestant
doctrine which attributes a similar infallibility
to the various authors who composed
what are now known to us as the Holy Scriptures.
Our men of science act, and the laws
of scientific investigation compel them to act,
as if it were not quite certain that the views
of scientific subjects held by those early
writers were so final as to render modern investigation
superfluous. It is useless to disguise
the fact that there is a real opposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
of method between intellect and faith, and
that the independence of the intellectual life
can never be fully secured unless all affirmations
based upon authority are treated as if
they were doubtful. This implies no change
of manner in the intellectual classes towards
those classes whose mental habits are founded
upon obedience. I mean that the man of science
does not treat the affirmations of any
priesthood with less respect than the affirmations
of his own scientific brethren; he applies
with perfect impartiality the same criticism
to all affirmations, from whatever source
they emanate. The intellect does not recognize
authority in any one, and intellectual
men do not treat the Pope, or the author of
Genesis, with less consideration than those
famous persons who in their day have been
the brightest luminaries of science. The difficulty,
however, remains, that whilst the intellectual
class has no wish to offend either
those who believe in the infallibility of the
Pope, or those who believe in the infallibility
of the author of Genesis, it is compelled to
conduct its own investigations as if those infallibilities
were matters of doubt and not of
certainty.</p>

<p>Why this is so, may be shown by a reference
to the operation of Nature in other ways.
The rewards of physical strength and health
are not given to the most moral, to the most
humane, to the most gentle, but to those who
have acted, and whose forefathers have acted,
in the most perfect accordance with the laws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
of their physical constitution. So the perfection
of the intellectual life is not given to the
most humble, the most believing, the most
obedient, but to those who use their minds
according to the most purely intellectual methods.
One of the most important truths that
human beings can know is the perfectly independent
working of the natural laws: one
of the best practical conclusions to be drawn
from the observation of Nature is that in the
conduct of our own understandings we should
use a like independence.</p>

<p>It would be wrong, in writing to you on
subjects so important as these, to shrink from
handling the real difficulties. Every one now
is aware that science must and will pursue
her own methods and work according to her
own laws, without concerning herself with
the most authoritative affirmations from without.
But if science said one thing and authoritative
tradition said another, no perfectly
ingenuous person could rest contented until
he had either reconciled the two or decidedly
rejected one of them. It is impossible for a
mind which is honest towards itself to admit
that a proposition is true and false at the same
time, true in science and false in theology.
Therefore, although the intellectual methods
are entirely independent of tradition, it may
easily happen that the indirect results of our
following those methods may be the overthrow
of some dogma which has for many
generations been considered indispensable to
man&rsquo;s spiritual welfare. With regard to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
contingency it need only be observed that
the intellectual forces of humanity must act,
like floods and winds, according to their own
laws; and that if they cast down any edifice
too weak to resist them, it must be because
the original constructors had not built it substantially,
or because those placed in charge
of it had neglected to keep it in repair. This
is their business, not ours. Our work is simply
to ascertain truth by our own independent
methods, alike without hostility to any
persons claiming authority, and without deference
to them.</p>

very large one, and I have not time or space to treat it properly
here. I may observe, however, briefly, that the genuine
spirit of tradition has almost entirely disappeared from English
industry and art, where it has been replaced by a spirit
of scientific investigation and experiment. The true traditional
spirit was still in full vigor in Japan a few years ago,
and it kept the industry and art of that country up to a remarkably
high standard. The traditional spirit is most favorable
to professional skill, because, under its influence, the
apprentice learns thoroughly, whereas under other influences
he often learns very imperfectly. The inferiority of English
painting to French (considered technically) has been due to
the prevalence of a traditional spirit in the French school
which was almost entirely absent from our own.</p>

<h3><i>WOMEN AND MARRIAGE.</i></h3>
<hr class="full" />


<h3 class="pt3">LETTER I.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF INTELLECTUAL
TASTES, WHO, WITHOUT HAVING AS YET ANY
PARTICULAR LADY IN VIEW, HAD EXPRESSED,
IN A GENERAL WAY, HIS DETERMINATION TO
GET MARRIED.</h5>

<p class="pro">How ignorant we all are about marriage&mdash;People wrong in
their estimates of the marriages of others&mdash;Effects of marriage
on the intellectual life&mdash;Two courses open&mdash;A wife
who would not interfere with elevated pursuits&mdash;A wife
capable of understanding them&mdash;Madame Ingres&mdash;Difference
in the education of the sexes&mdash;Difficulty of educating
a wife.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> subject of marriage is one concerning
which neither I nor anybody else can have
more than an infinitesimally small atom of
knowledge. Each of us knows how his or
her own marriage has turned out; but that,
in comparison with a knowledge of marriage
generally, is like a single plant in comparison
with the flora of the globe. The utmost experience
on this subject to be found in this
country extends to about three trials or experiments.
A man may become twice a widower,
and then marry a third time, but it
may be easily shown that the variety of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
experience is more than counterbalanced by
its incompleteness in each instance. For the
experiment to be conclusive even as to the
wisdom of one decision, it must extend over
half a lifetime. A true marriage is not a
mere temporary arrangement, and although
a young couple are said to be married as soon
as the lady has changed her name, the truth
is that the real marriage is a long slow intergrowth,
like that of two trees planted quite
close together in the forest.</p>

<p>The subject of marriage generally is one of
which men know less than they know of any
other subject of universal interest. People
are almost always wrong in their estimates of
the marriages of others, and the best proof
how little we know the real tastes and needs
of those with whom we have been most intimate,
is our unfailing surprise at the marriages
they make. Very old and experienced
people fancy they know a great deal about
younger couples, but their guesses, there is
good reason to believe, never <i>exactly</i> hit the
mark.</p>

<p>Ever since this idea, that marriage is a subject
we are all very ignorant about, had taken
root in my own mind, many little incidents
were perpetually occurring to confirm it; they
proved to me, on the one hand, how often I
had been mistaken about other people, and,
on the other hand, how mistaken other people
were concerning the only marriage I profess
to know anything about, namely, my
own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span> </p>

<p>Our ignorance is all the darker that few
men tell us the little that they know, that little
being too closely bound up with that innermost
privacy of life which every man of
right feeling respects in his own case, as in
the case of another. The only instances
which are laid bare to the public view are the
unhappy marriages, which are really not marriages
at all. An unhappy alliance bears exactly
the same relation to a true marriage
that disease does to health, and the quarrels
and misery of it are the crises by which Nature
tries to bring about either the recovery
of happiness, or the endurable peace of a settled
separation.</p>

<p>All that we really know about marriage is
that it is based upon the most powerful of all
our instincts, and that it shows its own justification
in its fruits, especially in the prolonged
and watchful care of children. But
marriage is very complex in its effects, and
there is one set of effects, resulting from it, to
which remarkably little attention has been
paid hitherto,&mdash;I mean its effects upon the intellectual
life. Surely they deserve consideration
by all who value culture.</p>

<p>I believe that for an intellectual man, only
two courses are open; either he ought to
marry some simple dutiful woman who will
bear him children, and see to the household
matters, and love him in a trustful spirit without
jealousy of his occupations; or else, on
the other hand, he ought to marry some highly
intelligent lady, able to carry her education
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
far beyond school experiences, and willing to
become his companion in the arduous paths
of intellectual labor. The danger in the first
of the two cases is that pointed out by Wordsworth
in some verses addressed to lake-tourists
who might feel inclined to buy a peasant&rsquo;s
cottage in Westmorland. The tourist would
spoil the little romantic spot if he bought it;
the charm of it is subtly dependent upon the
poetry of a simple life, and would be brushed
away by the influence of the things that are
necessary to people in the middle class. I
remember dining in a country inn with an
English officer whose ideas were singularly
unconventional. We were waited upon by
our host&rsquo;s daughter, a beautiful girl, whose
manners were remarkable for their natural
elegance and distinction. It seemed to us
both that no lady of rank could be more distinguished
than she was; and my companion
said that he thought a gentleman might do
worse than ask that girl to marry him, and
settle down quietly in that quiet mountain
village, far from the cares and vanities of the
world. That is a sort of dream which has occurred
no doubt to many an honorable man.
Some men have gone so far as to try to make
the dream a reality, and have married the
beautiful peasant. But the difficulty is that
she does not remain what she was; she becomes
a sort of make-belief lady, and then her
ignorance, which in her natural condition was
a charming <i>naïveté</i>, becomes an irritating defect.
If, however it were possible for an intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
man to marry some simple-hearted
peasant girl, and keep her carefully in her
original condition, I seriously believe that the
venture would be less perilous to his culture
than an alliance with some woman of our
Philistine classes, equally incapable of comprehending
his pursuits, but much more likely
to interfere with them. I once had a conversation
on this subject with a distinguished
artist, who is now a widower, and who is certainly
not likely to be prejudiced against marriage
by his own experience, which had been
an unusually happy one. His view was that
a man devoted to art might marry either a
plain-minded woman, who would occupy herself
exclusively with household matters and
shield his peace by taking these cares upon
herself, or else a woman quite capable of entering
into his artistic life; but he was convinced
that a marriage which exposed him to
unintelligent criticism and interference would
be dangerous in the highest degree. And of
the two kinds of marriage which he considered
possible he preferred the former, that
with the entirely ignorant and simple person
from whom no interference was to be apprehended.
He considered the first Madame Ingres
the true model of an artist&rsquo;s wife, because
she did all in her power to guard her
husband&rsquo;s peace against the daily cares of life
and never herself disturbed it, acting the part
of a breakwater which protects a space of
calm, and never destroys the peace that it
has made. This may be true for artists whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
occupation is rather æsthetic than intellectual,
and does not get much help or benefit
from talk; but the ideal marriage for a man
of great literary culture would be one permitting
some equality of companionship, or, if
not equality, at least interest. That this ideal
is not a mere dream, but may consolidate into
a happy reality, several examples prove; yet
these examples are not so numerous as to relieve
me from anxiety about your chances of
finding such companionship. The different
education of the two sexes separates them
widely at the beginning, and to meet on any
common ground of culture a second education
has to be gone through. It rarely happens
that there is resolution enough for this.</p>

<p>The want of thoroughness and reality in
the education of both sexes, but especially in
that of women, may be attributed to a sort of
policy which is not very favorable to companionship
in married life. It appears to be
thought wise to teach boys things which
women do not learn, in order to give women
a degree of respect for men&rsquo;s attainments,
which they would not be so likely to feel if
they were prepared to estimate them critically;
whilst girls are taught arts and languages
which until recently were all but excluded
from our public schools, and won no
rank at our universities. Men and women
had consequently scarcely any common
ground to meet upon, and the absence of serious
mental discipline in the training of
women made them indisposed to submit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
the irksomeness of that earnest intellectual
labor which might have remedied the deficiency.
The total lack of accuracy in their
mental habits was then, and is still for the
immense majority of women, the least easily
surmountable impediment to culture. The
history of many marriages which have failed
to realize intellectual companionship is comprised
in a sentence which was actually uttered
by one of the most accomplished of my
friends: &ldquo;She knew nothing when I married
her. I tried to teach her something; it made
her angry, and I gave it up.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO CONTEMPLATED
MARRIAGE.</h5>

<p class="pro">The foundations of the intellectual marriage&mdash;Marriage not a
snare or pitfall for the intellectual&mdash;Men of culture, who
marry badly, often have themselves to blame&mdash;For every
grade of the masculine intellect there exists a corresponding
grade of the feminine intellect&mdash;Difficulty of finding
the true mate&mdash;French University Professors&mdash;An extreme
case of intellectual separation&mdash;Regrets of a widow&mdash;Women
help us less by adding to our knowledge than
by understanding us.</p>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> several letters which have preceded this
I have indicated some of the differences between
the female sex and ours, and it is time
to examine the true foundations of the intellectual
marriage. Let me affirm, to begin
with, my profound faith in the natural arrangement.
There is in nature so much evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
care for the development of the intellectual
life, so much protection of it in the social
order, there are such admirable contrivances
for continuing it from century to century,
that we may fairly count upon some
provision for its necessities in marriage. Intellectual
men are not less alive to the charms
of women than other men are; indeed the
greatest of them have always delighted in the
society of women. If marriage were really
dangerous to the intellectual life, it would be
a moral snare or pitfall, from which the best
and noblest would be least likely to escape.
It is hard to believe that the strong passions
which so often accompany high intellectual
gifts were intended either to drive their possessors
into immorality or else to the misery
of ill-assorted unions.</p>

<p>No, there <i>is</i> such a thing as the intellectual
marriage, in which the intellect itself is married.
If such marriages are not frequent, it
is that they are not often made the deliberate
purpose of a wise alliance. Men choose their
wives because they are pretty, or because
they are rich, or because they are well-connected,
but rarely for the permanent interest
of their society. Yet who that had ever been
condemned to the dreadful embarrassments
of a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with an uncompanionable person,
could reflect without apprehension on a
lifetime of such <i>tête-à-têtes</i>?</p>

<p>When intellectual men suffer from this
misery they have themselves to blame.
What is the use of having any mental superiority,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
if, in a matter so enormously important
as the choice of a companion for life, it
fails to give us a warning when the choice is
absurdly unsuitable? When men complain,
as they do not unfrequently, that their wives
have no ideas, the question inevitably suggests
itself, why the superiority of the masculine
intellect did not, in these cases, permit it
to discover the defect in time? If we are so
clever as to be bored by ordinary women,
why cannot our cleverness find out the feminine
cleverness which would respond to it?</p>

<p>What I am going to say now is in its very
nature incapable of proof, and yet the longer
I live the more the truth of it is &ldquo;borne in
upon me.&rdquo; I feel convinced that for every
grade of the masculine intellect there exists a
corresponding grade of the feminine intellect,
so that a precisely suitable intellectual marriage
is always possible for every one. But
since the higher intellects are rare, and rare
in proportion to their elevation, it follows that
the difficulty of finding the true mate increases
with the mental strength and culture of the
man. If the &ldquo;mental princes,&rdquo; as Blake
called himself, are to marry the mental princesses,
they will not always discover them
quite so easily as kings&rsquo; sons find kings&rsquo;
daughters.</p>

<p>This difficulty of finding the true mate is
the real reason why so many clever men marry
silly or stupid women. The women about
them seem to be all very much alike, mentally;
it seems hopeless to expect any real companionship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
and the clever men are decided by
the color of a girl&rsquo;s eyes, or a thousand pounds
more in her dowry, or her relationship to a
peer of the realm.</p>

<p>It was remarked to me by a French university
professor, that although men in his position
had on the whole much more culture
than the middle class, they had an extraordinary
talent for winning the most vulgar and
ignorant wives. The explanation is, that
their marriages are not intellectual marriages
at all. The class of French professors is not advantageously
situated; it has not great facilities
for choice. Their incomes are so small
that, unless helped by private means, the first
thing they can prudently look to in a wife is
her utility as a domestic servant, which, in
fact, it is her destiny to become. The intellectual
disparity is from the beginning likely
to be very great, because the professor is confined
to the country-town where his <i>Lycée</i>
happens to be situated, and in that town he
does not always see the most cultivated society.
He may be an intellectual prince, but
where is he to find his princess? The marriage
begins without the idea of intellectual
companionship, and it continues as it began.
The girl was uneducated: it seems hopeless to
try to <span class="correction" title="amended from educated">educate</span> the woman; and then there is
the supreme difficulty, only to be overcome
by two wills at once most resolute and most
persistent, namely, how to find the time.
Years pass; the husband is occupied all day,
the wife needs to cheer herself with a little society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
and goes to sit with neighbors who are
not likely to add anything valuable to her
knowledge or to give any elevation to her
thoughts. Then comes the final fixing and
crystallization of her intellect, after which,
however much pains and labor might be taken
by the pair, she is past the possibility of
change.</p>

<p>These women are often so good and devoted
that their husbands enjoy great happiness;
but it is a kind of happiness curiously independent
of the lady&rsquo;s presence. The professor
may love his wife, and fully appreciate her
qualities as a housekeeper, but he passes a
more interesting evening with some male
friend whose reading is equal to his own.
Sometimes the lady perceives this, and it is an
element of sadness in her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never see my husband,&rdquo; she tells you,
not in anger. &ldquo;His work occupies him all
day, and in the evening he sees his friends.&rdquo;
The pair walk out together twice a week. I
sometimes wonder what they say to each
other during those conjugal promenades.
They talk about their children, probably, and
the little recurring difficulties about money.
He cannot talk about his studies, or the intellectual
speculations which his studies continually
suggest.</p>

<p>The most extreme cases of intellectual separation
between husband and wife that ever
came under my observation was, however,
not that of a French professor, but a highly-cultivated
Scotch lawyer. He was one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
most intellectual men I ever knew&mdash;a little
cynical, but full of original power, and uncommonly
well-informed. His theory was,
that women ought not to be admitted into
the region of masculine thought&mdash;that it was
not good for them; and he acted so consistently
up to this theory, that although he
would open his mind with the utmost frankness
to a male acquaintance over the evening
whisky-toddy, there was not whisky enough
in all Scotland to make him frank in the
presence of his wife. She really knew nothing
whatever about his intellectual existence;
and yet there was nothing in his ways of
thinking which an honorable man need conceal
from an intelligent woman. His theory
worked well enough in practice, and his reserve
was so perfect that it may be doubted
whether even feminine subtlety ever suspected
it. The explanation of his system may perhaps
have been this. He was an exceedingly
busy man; he felt that he had not time to teach
his wife to know him as he was, and so preferred
to leave her with her own conception
of him, rather than disturb that conception
when he believed it impossible to replace it
by a completely true one. We all act in that
way with those whom we consider <i>quite</i> excluded
from our private range of thought.</p>

<p>All this may be very prudent and wise:
there may be degrees of conjugal felicity, satisfactory
in their way, without intellectual
intercourse, and yet I cannot think that any
man of high culture could regard his marriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
as altogether a successful one so long as his
wife remained shut out from his mental life.
Nor is the exclusion always quite agreeable
to the lady herself. A widow said to me
that her husband had never thought it necessary
to try to raise her to his own level,
yet she believed that with his kindly help
she might have attained it.</p>

<p>You with your masculine habits, may observe,
as to this, that if the lady had seriously
cared to attain a higher level she might have
achieved it by her own private independent
effort. But this is exactly what the feminine
nature never does. A clever woman is the
best of pupils, when she loves her teacher, but
the worst of solitary learners.</p>

<p>It is not by adding to our knowledge, but
by understanding us, that women are our
helpers. They understand us far better than
men do, when once they have the degree of
preliminary information which enables them
to enter into our pursuits. Men are occupied
with their personal works and thoughts, and
have wonderfully little sympathy left to enable
them to comprehend us; but a woman,
by her divine sympathy&mdash;divine indeed, since
it was given by God for this&mdash;can enter into
our inmost thought, and make allowances for
all our difficulties. Talk about your work
and its anxieties to a club of masculine friends,
they will give very little heed to you; they
are all thinking about themselves, and they
will dislike your egotism because they have
so much egotism of their own, which yours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
invades and inconveniences. But talk in the
same way to any woman who has education
enough to enable her to follow you, and she
will listen so kindly, and so very intelligently,
that you will be betrayed into interminable
confidences.</p>

<p>Now, although an intellectual man may not
care to make himself understood by all the
people in the street, it is not a good thing for
him to feel that he is understood by nobody.
The intellectual life is sometimes a fearfully
solitary one. Unless he lives in a great capital
the man devoted to that life is more than
all other men liable to suffer from isolation,
to feel utterly alone beneath the deafness of
space and the silence of the stars. Give him
one friend who can understand him, who will
not leave him, who will always be accessible
by day and night&mdash;one friend, one kindly
listener, just one, and the whole universe is
changed. It is deaf and indifferent no longer,
and whilst <i>she</i> listens, it seems as if all men
and angels listened also, so perfectly his
thought is mirrored in the light of her answering
eyes.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO CONTEMPLATED
MARRIAGE.</h5>

<p class="pro">The intellectual ideal of marriage&mdash;The danger of dulness&mdash;To
be counteracted only by the renewal of both minds&mdash;Example
of Lady Baker&mdash;Separation of the sexes by an
old prejudice about education&mdash;This prejudice on the decline&mdash;Influence
of the late Prince Consort.</p>

<p><span class="sc">How</span> far may you hope to realize the intellectual
ideal of marriage? Have I ever observed
in actual life any approximate realization
of that ideal?</p>

<p>These are the two questions which conclude
and epitomize the last of your recent letters.
Let me endeavor to answer them as satisfactorily
as the obscurity of the subject will permit.</p>

<p>The intellectual ideal seems to be that of a
conversation on all the subjects you most care
about, which should never lose its interest.
Is it possible that two people should live together
and talk to each other every day for
twenty years without knowing each other&rsquo;s
views too well for them to seem worth expressing
or worth listening to? There are
friends whom we know <i>too</i> well, so that our
talk with them has less of refreshment and
entertainment than a conversation with the
first intelligent stranger on the quarter-deck
of the steamboat. It is evident that from the
intellectual point of view this is the great
danger of marriage. It may become dull,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
not because the mental force of either of the
parties has declined, but because each has
come to know so accurately beforehand what
the other will say on any given topic, that
inquiry is felt to be useless. This too perfect
intimacy, which has ended many a friendship
outside of marriage, may also terminate
the intellectual life in matrimony itself.</p>

<p>Let us not pass too lightly over this danger,
for it is not to be denied. Unless carefully
provided against, it will gradually extinguish
the light that plays between the wedded intelligences
as the electric light burns between
two carbon points.</p>

<p>I venture to suggest, however, that this
evil may be counteracted by persons of some
energy and originality. This is one of those
very numerous cases in which an evil is sure
to arrive if nothing is done to prevent it, yet
in which the evil need not arrive when those
whom it menaces are forewarned. To take
an illustration intelligible in these days of
steam-engines. We know that if the water
is allowed to get very low in the boiler a destructive
explosion will be the consequence;
yet, since every stoker is aware of this, such
explosions are not of frequent occurrence.
That evil is continually approaching and yet
continually averted by the exercise of human
foresight.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that a married couple are
clearly aware that in the course of years their
society is sure to become mutually uninteresting
unless something is done to preserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>
the earlier zest of it. What is that something?</p>

<p>That which an author does for the unknown
multitude of his readers.</p>

<p>Every author who succeeds takes the
trouble to renew his mind either by fresh
knowledge or new thoughts. Is it not at least
equally worth while to do as much to preserve
the interest of marriage? Without undervaluing
the friendly adhesion of many readers,
without affecting any contempt for fame,
which is dearer to the human heart than
wealth itself whenever it appears to be not
wholly unattainable, may not I safely affirm
that the interest of married life, from its very
<i>nearness</i>, has a still stronger influence upon
the mind of any thinking person, of either sex,
than the approbation of unnumbered readers
in distinct countries or continents? You never
<i>see</i> the effect of your thinking on your readers;
they live and die far away from you, a
few write letters of praise or criticism, the
thousands give no sign. But the wife is with
you always, she is almost as near to you as
your own body; the world, to you, is a figure-picture
in which there is one figure, the
rest is merely background. And if an author
takes pains to renew his mind for the people
in the background, is it not at least equally
worth your while to bring fresh thought for
the renewal of your life with her?</p>

<p>This, then, is my theory of the intellectual
marriage, that the two wedded intellects
ought to renew themselves continually for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
each other. And I argue that if this were
done in earnest, the otherwise inevitable dulness
would be perpetually kept at bay.</p>

<p>To the other question, whether in actual life
I have ever seen this realized, I answer yes,
in several instances.</p>

<p>Not in very many instances, yet in more
than one. Women, when they have conceived
the idea that this renewal is necessary, have
resolution enough for the realization of it.
There is hardly any task too hard for them,
if they believe it essential to the conjugal life.
I could give you the name and address of one
who mastered Greek in order not to be excluded
from her husband&rsquo;s favorite pursuit;
others have mastered other languages for the
same object, and even some branch of science
for which the feminine mind has less natural
affinity than it has for imaginative literature.
Their remarkable incapacity for independent
mental labor is accompanied by an
equally remarkable capacity for labor under
an accepted masculine guidance. In this
connection I may without impropriety mention
one Englishwoman, for she is already
celebrated, the wife of Sir Samuel Baker, the
discoverer of the Albert Nyanza. She stood
with him on the shore of that unknown sea,
when first it was beheld by English eyes; she
had passed with him through all the hard preliminary
toils and trials. She had learned
Arabic with him in a year of necessary but
wearisome delay; her mind had travelled with
his mind as her feet had followed his footsteps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
Scarcely less beautiful, if less heroic, is the
picture of the geologist&rsquo;s wife, Mrs. Buckland,
who taught herself to reconstruct broken fossils,
and did it with a surprising delicacy, and
patience, and skill, full of science, yet more
than science, the perfection of feminine art.</p>

<p>The privacy of married life often prevents
us from knowing the extent to which intelligent
women have renewed their minds by
fresh and varied culture for the purpose of retaining
their ascendency over their husbands,
or to keep up the interest of their lives. It is
done much more frequently by women than
by men. They have so much less egotism, so
much more adaptability, that they fit themselves
to us oftener than we adapt ourselves
to them. But in a quiet perfect marriage these
efforts would be mutual. The husband would
endeavor to make life interesting to his companion
by taking a share in some pursuit which
was really her own. It is easier for us than
it was for our ancestors to do this&mdash;at least
for our immediate ancestors. There existed,
fifty years ago, a most irrational prejudice,
very strongly rooted in the social conventions
of the time, about masculine and feminine accomplishments.
The educations of the two
sexes were so trenchantly separated that
neither had access to the knowledge of the
other. The men had learned Latin and Greek,
of which the women were ignorant; the
women had learned French or Italian, which
the men could neither read nor speak. The
ladies studied fine art, not seriously, but it occupied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
a good deal of their time and thoughts;
the gentlemen had a manly contempt for it,
which kept them, as contempt always does, in
a state of absolute ignorance. The intellectual
separation of the sexes was made as complete
as possible by the conventionally received idea
that a man could not learn what girls learned
without effeminacy, and that if women aspired
to men&rsquo;s knowledge they would forfeit the
delicacy of their sex. This illogical prejudice
was based on a bad syllogism of this kind:&mdash;</p>

<p>Girls speak French, and learn music and drawing.
Benjamin speaks French, and learns music and drawing.
Benjamin is a girl.</p>

<p>And the prejudice, powerful as it was, had
not even the claim of any considerable antiquity.
Think how strange and unreasonable
it would have seemed to Lady Jane Grey and
Sir Philip Sidney! In their time, ladies and
gentlemen studied the same things, the world
of culture was the same for both, and they
could meet in it as in a garden.</p>

<p>Happily we are coming back to the old rational
notion of culture as independent of the
question of sex. Latin and Greek are not unfeminine;
they were spoken by women in
Athens and Rome; the modern languages are
fit for a man to learn, since men use them
continually on the battle-fields and in the parliaments
and exchanges of the world. Art is
a manly business, if ever any human occupation
could be called manly, for the utmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
efforts of the strongest men are needed for
success in it.</p>

<p>The increasing interest in the fine arts, the
more important position given to modern languages
in the universities, the irresistible attractions
and growing authority of science,
all tend to bring men and women together on
subjects understood by both, and therefore
operate directly in favor of intellectual interests
in marriage. You will not suspect me of
a snobbish desire to pay compliments to royalty
if I trace some of these changes in public
opinion to the example and influence of the
Prince Consort, operating with some effect
during his life, yet with far greater force
since he was taken away from us. The truth
is, that the most modern English ideal of gentlemanly
culture is that which Prince Albert,
to a great extent, realized in his own person.
Perhaps his various accomplishments may be
a little embellished or exaggerated in the popular
belief, but it is unquestionable that his
notion of culture was very large and liberal,
and quite beyond the narrow pedantry of the
preceding age. There was nothing in it to
exclude a woman, and we know that she who
loved him entered largely into the works and
recreations of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span></p>
<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO CONTEMPLATED
MARRIAGE.</h5>

<p class="pro">Women do not of themselves undertake intellectual labor&mdash;Their
resignation to ignorance&mdash;Absence of scientific curiosity
in women&mdash;They do not accumulate accurate knowledge&mdash;Archimedes
in his bath&mdash;Rarity of inventions due to
women&mdash;Exceptions.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Before</span> saying much about the influence of
marriage on the intellectual life, it is necessary
to make some inquiry into the intellectual
nature of women.</p>

<p>The first thing to be noted is that, with exceptions
so rare as to be practically of no
importance to an argument, women do not
of themselves undertake intellectual labor.
Even in the situations most favorable for labor
of that kind, women do not undertake it unless
they are urged to it, and directed in it, by
some powerful masculine influence. In the
absence of that influence, although their minds
are active, that activity neither tends to discipline
nor to the accumulation of knowledge.
Women who are not impelled by some masculine
influence are not superior, either in
knowledge or discipline of the mind, at the
age of fifty to what they were at the age of
twenty-five. In other words, they have not
in themselves the motive powers which can
cause an intellectual advance.</p>

<p>The best illustration of this is a sisterhood
of three or four rich old maids, with all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
advantages of leisure. You will observe that
they invariably remain, as to their education,
where they were left by their teachers many
years before. They will often lament, perhaps,
that in their day education was very inferior
to what it is now; but it never occurs
to them that the large leisure of subsequent
years might, had it been well employed, have
supplied those deficiencies of which they are
sensible. Nothing is more curiously remote
from masculine habits than the resignation to
particular degrees of ignorance, as to the inevitable,
which a woman will express in a
manner which says: &ldquo;You know I am so; you
know that I cannot make myself better informed.&rdquo;
They are like perfect billiard-balls
on a perfect table, which stop when no longer
impelled, wherever they may happen to be.</p>

<p>It is this absence of intellectual initiative
which causes the great ignorance of women.
What they have been well taught, that they
know, but they do not increase their stores of
knowledge. Even in what most interests
them, theology, they repeat, but do not extend,
their information. All the effort of their
minds appears (so far as an outside observer
may presume to judge) to act like water on a
picture, which brings out the colors that already
exist upon the canvas but does not add
anything to the design. There is a great and
perpetual freshness and vividness in their conceptions,
which is often lacking in our own.
Our conceptions fade, and are replaced; theirs
are not replaced, but refreshed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span> </p>

<p>What many women do for their theological
conceptions or opinions, others do with reference
to the innumerable series of questions of
all kinds which present themselves in the
course of life. They attempt to solve them
by the help of knowledge acquired in girlhood;
and if that cannot be done, they either
give them up as beyond the domain of women,
or else trust to hearsay for a solution. What
they will <i>not</i> do is to hunt the matter out unaided,
and get an accurate answer by dint of
independent investigation.</p>

<p>There is another characteristic of women,
not peculiar to them, for many men have it in
an astonishing degree, and yet more general
in the female sex than in the male: I allude
to the absence of scientific curiosity. Ladies
see things of the greatest wonder and interest
working in their presence and for their service
without feeling impelled to make any inquiries
into the manner of their working. I
could mention many very curious instances
of this, but I select one which seems typical.
Many years ago I happened to be in a room
filled with English ladies, most of whom were
highly intelligent, and the conversation happened
to turn upon a sailing-boat which belonged
to me. One of the ladies observed
that sails were not of much use, since they
could only be available to push the boat in
the direction of the wind; a statement which
all the other ladies received with approbation.
Now, all these ladies had seen ships working
under canvas against head-winds, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
might have reflected that without that portion
of the art of seamanship every vessel unprovided
with steam would assuredly drift
upon a lee-shore; but it was not in the feminine
nature to make a scientific observation
of that kind. You will answer, perhaps, that
I could scarcely expect ladies to investigate
men&rsquo;s business, and that seamanship is essentially
the business of our own sex. But the
truth is, that all English people, no matter of
what sex, have so direct an interest in the
maritime activity of England, that they might
reasonably be expected to know the one primary
conquest on which for many centuries
that activity has depended, the conquest of
the opposing wind, the sublimest of the early
victories of science. And this absence of
curiosity in women extends to things they
use every day. They never seem to want to
know the insides of things as we do. All
ladies know that steam makes a locomotive
go; but they rest satisfied with that, and do
not inquire further <i>how</i> the steam sets the
wheels in motion. They know that it is necessary
to wind up their watches, but they do
not care to inquire into the real effects of that
little exercise of force.</p>

<p>Now this absence of the investigating spirit
has very wide and important consequences.
The first consequence of it is that women do
not naturally accumulate accurate knowledge.
Left to themselves, they accept various
kinds of teaching, but they do not by any
analysis of their own either put that teaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
to any serious intellectual test, or qualify
themselves for any extension of it by independent
and original discovery. We of the
male sex are seldom clearly aware how much
of our practical force, of the force which discovers
and originates, is due to our common
habit of analytical observation; yet it is
scarcely too much to say that most of our inventions
have been suggested by actually or
intellectually pulling something else in pieces.
And such of our discoveries as cannot be
traced directly to analysis are almost always
due to habits of general observation which
lead us to take note of some fact apparently
quite remote from what it helps us to arrive
at. One of the best instances of this indirect
utility of habitual observation, as it is one of
the earliest, is what occurred to Archimedes
in his bath. When the water displaced by
his body overflowed, he noticed the fact of
displacement, and at once perceived its applicability
to the cubic measurement of complicated
bodies. It is possible that if his mind
had not been exercised at the time about the
adulteration of the royal crown, it would not
have been led to anything by the overflowing
of his bath; but the capacity to receive a suggestion
of that kind is, I believe, a capacity
exclusively masculine. A woman would have
noticed the overflowing, but she would have
noticed it only as a cause of disorder or inconvenience.</p>

<p>This absence of the investigating and discovering
tendencies in women is confirmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
by the extreme rarity of inventions due to
women, even in the things which most interest
and concern them. The stocking-loom
and the sewing-machine are the two inventions
which would most naturally have been
hit upon by women, for people are naturally
inventive about things which relieve <i>themselves</i>
of labor, or which increase their own
possibilities of production; and yet the stocking-loom
and the sewing-machine are both of
them masculine ideas, carried out to practical
efficiency by masculine energy and perseverance.
So I believe that all the improvements
in pianos are due to men, though women
have used pianos much more than men
have used them.</p>

<p>This, then, is in my view the most important
negative characteristic of women, that
they do not push forwards intellectually by
their own force. There have been a few instances
in which they have written with
power and originality, have become learned,
and greatly superior, no doubt, to the majority
of men. There are three or four women
in England, and as many on the Continent,
who have lived intellectually in harness for
many years, and who unaffectedly delight in
strenuous intellectual labor, giving evidence
both of fine natural powers and the most persevering
culture; but these women have usually
been encouraged in their work by some
near masculine influence. And even if it
were possible, which it is not, to point to
some female Archimedes or Leonardo da
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
Vinci, it is not the rare exceptions which concern
us, but the prevalent rule of Nature.
Without desiring to compare our most
learned ladies with anything so disagreeable
to the eye as a bearded woman, I may observe
that Nature generally has a few exceptions
to all her rules, and that as women having
beards are a physical exception, so women
who naturally study and investigate are
intellectual exceptions. Once more let me
repudiate any malicious intention in establishing
so unfortunate and <i>maladroite</i> an association
of ideas, for nothing is less agreeable
than a woman with a beard, whilst, on
the contrary, the most intellectual of women
may at the same time be the most permanently
charming.</p>

<h3>LETTER V.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO CONTEMPLATED
MARRIAGE.</h5>

<p class="pro">The danger of deviation&mdash;Danger from increased expenditure&mdash;Nowhere
so great as in England&mdash;Complete absorption
in business&mdash;Case of a tradesman&mdash;Case of a solicitor&mdash;The
pursuit of comfort dangerous to the Intellectual Life&mdash;The
meanness of its results&mdash;Fireside purposes&mdash;Danger
of deviation in rich marriages&mdash;George Sand&rsquo;s study of
this in her story of &ldquo;Valvèdre.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Amongst</span> the dangers of marriage, one of
those most to be dreaded by a man given to
intellectual pursuits is the deviation which,
in one way or other, marriage inevitably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
produces. It acts like the pointsman on a
railway, who, by pulling a lever, sends the
train in another direction. The married man
never goes, or hardly ever goes, exactly on
the same intellectual lines which he would
have followed if he had remained a bachelor.
This deviation may or may not be a gain; it
is always a most serious danger.</p>

<p>Sometimes the deviation is produced by the
necessity for a stricter attention to money,
causing a more unremitting application to
work that pays well, and a proportionate neglect
of that which can only give extension to
our knowledge and clearness to our views.</p>

<p>In no country is this danger so great as it
is in England, where the generally expensive
manner of living, and the prevalent desire to
keep families in an ideally perfect state of
physical comfort, produce an absorption in
business which in all but the rarest instances
leaves no margin for intellectual labor.
There are, no doubt, some remarkable examples
of men earning a large income by a
laborious profession, who have gained reputation
in one of the sciences or in some
branch of literature, but these are very exceptional
cases. A man who works at his
profession as most Englishmen with large
families have to work, can seldom enjoy that
surplus of nervous energy which would be
necessary to carry him far in literature or
science. I remember meeting an English
tradesman in the railway between Paris and
the coast, who told me that he was obliged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
visit France very frequently, yet could not
speak French, which was a great deficiency
and inconvenience to him. &ldquo;Why not learn?&rdquo;
I then asked, and received the following answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to work at my business all day
long, and often far into the night. When
the day&rsquo;s work is over I generally feel very
tired, and want rest; but if I don&rsquo;t happen to
feel quite so tired, then it is not work that I
need, but recreation, of which I get very little.
I never feel the courage to set to work
at the French grammar, though it would be
both pleasant and useful to me to know
French; indeed, I constantly feel the want of
it. It might, perhaps, be possible to learn
from a phrase-book in the railway train, but
to save time I always travel at night. Being
a married man, I have to give my whole attention
to my business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A solicitor with a large practice in London
held nearly the same language. He worked
at his office all day, and often brought home
the most difficult work for the quiet of his
own private study after the household had
gone to bed. The little reading that he could
indulge in was light reading. In reality the
profession intruded even on his few hours of
leisure, for he read many of the columns in
the <i>Times</i> which relate to law or legislation,
and these make at the end of a few years an
amount of reading sufficient for the mastery
of a foreign literature. This gentleman answered
very accurately to M. Taine&rsquo;s description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
of the typical Englishman, absorbed in
business and the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>In these cases it is likely that the effect of
marriage was not inwardly felt as a deviation;
but when culture has been fairly begun,
and marriage hinders the pursuit of it,
or makes it deviate from the chosen path,
then there is often an inward consciousness
of the fact, not without its bitterness.</p>

<p>A remarkable article on &ldquo;Luxury,&rdquo; in the
second volume of the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>,
deals with this subject in a manner evidently
suggested by serious reflection and experience.
The writer considers the effects of the
pursuit of comfort (never carried so far as it
is now) on the higher moral and intellectual
life. The comforts of a bachelor were not
what the writer meant; these are easily procured,
and seldom require the devotion of all
the energies. The &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; which is really
dangerous to intellectual growth is that of a
family establishment, because it so easily becomes
the one absorbing object of existence.
Men who began life with the feeling that they
would willingly devote their powers to great
purposes, like the noble examples of past
times who labored and suffered for the intellectual
advancement of their race, and had
starvation for their reward, or in some cases
even the prison and the stake&mdash;men who in
their youth felt themselves to be heirs of a
nobility of spirit like that of Bruno, of Swammerdam,
of Spinoza, have too often found
themselves in the noon of life concentrating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
all the energies of body and soul on the acquisition
of ugly millinery and uglier upholstery,
and on spreading extravagant tables to
feed uncultivated guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; says the writer of the
article just alluded to, &ldquo;it is impossible to
say why men were made, but assuming that
they were made for some purpose, of which
the faculties which they possess afford evidence,
it follows that they were intended to
do many other things besides providing for
their families and enjoying their society.
They were meant to know, to act, and to feel&mdash;to
know everything which the mind is able
to contemplate, to name, and to classify; to
do everything which the will, prompted by
the passions and guided by the conscience,
can undertake; and, subject to the same
guidance, to feel in its utmost vigor every
emotion which the contemplation of the various
persons and objects which surround us
can excite. This view of the objects of life
affords an almost infinite scope for human
activity in different directions; but it also
shows that it is in the highest degree dangerous
to its beauty and its worth to allow any
one side of life to become the object of idolatry;
and there are many reasons for thinking
that domestic happiness is rapidly assuming
that position in the minds of the more comfortable
classes of Englishmen.... It is a
singular and affecting thing, to see how every
manifestation of human energy bears witness
to the shrewdness of the current maxim that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
a large income is a necessary of life. Whatever
is done for money is done admirably
well. Give a man a specific thing to make or
to write, and pay him well for it, and you may
with a little trouble secure an excellent article;
but the ability which does these things
so well, might have been and ought to have
been trained to far higher things, which for
the most part are left undone, because the
clever workman thinks himself bound to
earn what will keep himself, his wife, and his
six or seven children, up to the established
standard of comfort. What was at first a
necessity, perhaps an unwelcome one, becomes
by degrees a habit and a pleasure, and
men who might have done memorable and
noble things, if they had learnt in time to
consider the doing of such things an object
worth living for, lose the power and the wish
to live for other than fireside purposes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this kind of intellectual deviation, you
may answer, is not strictly the consequence
of marriage, <i>quâ</i> marriage; it is one of the
consequences of a degree of relative poverty,
produced by the larger expenditure of married
life, but which might be just as easily
produced by a certain degree of money-pressure
in the condition of a bachelor. Let me
therefore point out a kind of deviation which
may be as frequently observed in rich marriages
as in poor ones. Suppose the case of a
bachelor with a small but perfectly independent
income amounting to some hundreds a
year, who is devoted to intellectual pursuits,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
and spends his time in study or with cultivated
friends of his own, choosing friends
whose society is an encouragement and a
help. Suppose that this man makes an exceedingly
prudent marriage, with a rich woman,
you may safely predict, in this instance,
intellectual deviations of a kind perilous to
the highest culture. He will have new calls
upon his time, his society will no longer be
entirely of his own choosing, he will no longer
be able to devote himself with absolute
singleness of purpose to studies from which
his wife must necessarily be excluded. If he
were to continue faithful to his old habits,
and shut himself up every day in his library
or laboratory, or set out on frequent scientific
expeditions, his wife would either be a
lady of quite extraordinary perfection of temper,
or else entirely indifferent in her feelings
towards him, if she did not regard his pursuits
with quickly-increasing jealousy. She
would think, and justifiably think, that he
ought to give more of his time to the enjoyment
of her society, that he ought to be more
by her side in the carriage and in the drawing-room,
and if he loved her he would yield
to these kindly and reasonable wishes. He
would spend many hours of every day in a
manner not profitable to his great pursuits,
and many weeks of every year in visits to
her friends. His position would be even less
favorable to study in some respects than that
of a professional man. It would be difficult
for him, if an amateur artist, to give that unremitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
attention to painting which the
professional painter gives. He could not say,
&ldquo;I do this for you and for our children;&rdquo; he
could only say, &ldquo;I do it for my own pleasure,&rdquo;
which is not so graceful an excuse. As
a bachelor, he might work as professional
people work, but his marriage would strongly
accentuate the amateur character of his position.
It is possible that if his labors had won
great fame the lady might bear the separation
more easily, for ladies always take a noble
pride in the celebrity of their husbands;
but the best and worthiest intellectual labor
often brings no fame whatever, and notoriety
is a mere accident of some departments of
the intellectual life, and not its ultimate object.</p>

<p>George Sand, in her admirable novel &ldquo;Valvèdre,&rdquo;
has depicted a situation of this kind
with the most careful delicacy of touch. Valvèdre
was a man of science, who attempted
to continue the labors of his intellectual life
after marriage had united him to a lady incapable
of sharing them. The reader pities
both, and sympathizes with both. It is hard,
on the one hand, that a man endowed by nature
with great talents for scientific work
should not go on with a career already gloriously
begun; and yet, on the other hand, a
woman who is so frequently abandoned for
science may blamelessly feel some jealousy
of science.</p>

<p>Valvèdre, in narrating the story of his
unhappy wedded life, said that Alida wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
to have at her orders a perfect gentleman to
accompany her, but that he felt in himself
a more serious ambition. He had not aimed
at fame, but he had thought it possible to become
a useful servant, bringing his share of
patient and courageous seekings to the edifice
of the sciences. He had hoped that Alida
would understand this. &ldquo;&rsquo;There is time
enough for everything,&rsquo; she said, still retaining
him in the useless wandering life that she
had chosen. &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;but
on condition that I lose no more of it; and it
is not in this wandering life, cut to pieces by
a thousand unforeseen interruptions, that I
can make the hours yield their profit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ah! we come to the point!&rsquo; exclaimed
Alida impetuously. &lsquo;You wish to leave me,
and to travel alone in impossible regions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;No, I will work near you and abandon
certain observations which it would be necessary
to make at too great a distance, but you
also will sacrifice something: we will not see
so many idle people, we will settle somewhere
for a fixed time. It shall be where you will,
and if the place does not suit you, we will try
another; but from time to time you will permit
me a phase of sedentary work.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Yes, yes, you want to live for yourself
alone; you have lived enough for me. I understand;
your love is satiated and at an
end.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing could conquer her conviction
<i>that study was her rival</i>, and that love was
only possible in idleness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;To love is everything,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and he
who loves has not time to concern himself
with anything else. Whilst the husband is
intoxicating himself with the marvels of
science, the wife languishes and dies. It is
the destiny which awaits me; and since I am
a burden to you, I should do better to die at
once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little later Valvèdre ventured to hint
something about work, hoping to conquer his
wife&rsquo;s <i>ennui</i>, on which she proclaimed the
hatred of work as a sacred right of her nature
and position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Nobody ever taught me to work,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;and I did not marry under a promise
to begin again at the <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> of things. Whatever
I know I have learned by intuition, by
reading without aim or method. I am a
woman; my destiny is to love my husband
and bring up children. It is very strange
that my husband should be the person who
counsels me to think of something better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am far from suggesting that Madame
Valvèdre is an exact representative of her
sex, but the sentiments which in her are exaggerated,
and expressed with passionate
plainness, are in much milder form very prevalent
sentiments indeed; and Valvèdre&rsquo;s great
difficulty, how to get leave to prosecute his
studies with the degree of devotion necessary
to make them fruitful, is not at all an uncommon
difficulty with intellectual men after
marriage. The character of Madame Valvèdre,
being passionate and excessive, led her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
to an open expression of her feelings; but
feelings of a like kind, though milder in degree,
exist frequently below the surface, and
may be detected by any vigilant observer of
human nature. That such feelings are very
natural it is impossible even for a <i>savant</i> to
deny; but whilst admitting the clear right of
a woman to be preferred by a man to science
when once he has married her, let me observe
that the man might perhaps do wisely, before
the knot is tied, to ascertain whether her intellectual
dowry is rich enough to compensate
him for the sacrifices she is likely to exact.</p>

<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>

<h5>TO A SOLITARY STUDENT.</h5>

<p class="pro">Need of a near intellectual friendship in solitude&mdash;Persons
who live independently of custom run a peculiar risk in
marriage&mdash;Women by nature more subservient to custom
than men are&mdash;Difficulty of conciliating solitude and marriage&mdash;De
Sénancour&mdash;The marriages of eccentrics&mdash;Their
wives either protect them or attempt to reform them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Isolated</span> as you are, by the very superiority
of your culture, from the ignorant provincial
world around you, I cannot but believe
that marriage is essential to your intellectual
health and welfare. If you married some
cultivated woman, bred in the cultivated society
of a great capital, that companionship
would give you an independence of surrounding
influences which nothing else can give.
You fancy that by shutting yourself up in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
country house you are uninfluenced by the
world around you. It is a great error. You
know that you are isolated, that you are
looked upon and probably ridiculed as an eccentric,
and this knowledge, which it is impossible
to banish from your mind, deprives
your thinking of elasticity and grace. You
urgently need the support of an intellectual
friendship quite near to you, under your own
roof. Bachelors in great cities feel this necessity
less.</p>

<p>Still remember, that whoever has arranged
his life independently of custom runs a peculiar
risk in marriage. Women are by nature
far more subservient to custom than we are,
more than we can easily conceive. The danger
of marriage, for a person of your tastes, is
that a woman entering your house might enter
it as the representative of that minutely-interfering
authority which you continually ignore.
And let us never forget that a perfect obedience
to custom requires great sacrifices of
time and money that you might not be disposed
to make, and which certainly would
interfere with study. You value and enjoy
your solitude, well knowing how great a thing
it is to be master of all your hours. It is difficult
to conciliate solitude, or even a wise
and suitable selection of acquaintances, with
the semi-publicity of marriage. Heads of
families receive many persons in their houses
whom they would never have invited, and
from whose society they derive little pleasure
and no profit. De Sénancour had plans of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
studious retirement, and hoped that the
&ldquo;<i>douce intimité</i>&rdquo; of marriage might be compatible
with these cherished projects. But
marriage, he found, drew him into the circle
of ordinary provincial life, and he always
suffered from its influences.</p>

<p>You are necessarily an eccentric. In the
neighborhood where you live it is an eccentricity
to study, for nobody but you studies
anything. A man so situated is fortunate
when this feeling of eccentricity is alleviated,
and unfortunate when it is increased. A
wife would certainly do one or the other.
Married to a very superior woman, able to
understand the devotion to intellectual aims,
you would be much relieved of the painful
consciousness of eccentricity; but a woman
of less capacity would intensify it.</p>

<p>So far as we can observe the married life of
others, it seems to me that I have met with
instances of men, constituted and occupied
very much as you are, who have found in
marriage a strong protection against the ignorant
judgments of their neighbors, and an
assurance of intellectual peace; whilst in
other cases it has appeared rather as if their
solitude were made more a cause of conscious
suffering, as if the walls of their cabinets
were pulled down for the boobies outside to
stare at them and laugh at them. A woman
will either take your side against the customs
of the little world around, or she will take
the side of custom against you. If she loves
you deeply, and if there is some visible result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
of your labors in fame and money, she may
possibly do the first, and then she will protect
your tranquillity better than a force of
policemen, and give you a delightful sense of
reconciliation with all humanity; but many
of her most powerful instincts tend the other
way. She has a natural sympathy with all
the observances of custom, and you neglect
them; she is fitted for social life, which you
are not. Unless you win her wholly to your
side, she may undertake the enterprise of
curing your eccentricities and adapting you
to the ideal of her caste. This may be highly
satisfactory to the operator, but it is full
of inconveniences to the patient.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>

<h5>TO A LADY OF HIGH CULTURE WHO FOUND IT
DIFFICULT TO ASSOCIATE WITH PERSONS OF
HER OWN SEX.</h5>

<p class="pro">Men are not very good judges of feminine conversation&mdash;The
interest of it would be increased if women could be more
freely initiated into great subjects&mdash;Small subjects interesting
when seen in relation to central ideas&mdash;That ladies
of superior faculty ought rather to elevate female society
than withdraw from it&mdash;Women when displaced do not
appear happy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">What</span> you confided to me in our last interesting
conversation has given me material
for reflection, and afforded a glimpse of a
state of things which I have sometimes suspected
without having data for any positive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
conclusion. The society of women is usually
sought by men during hours of mental relaxation,
and we naturally find such a charm in
their mere presence, especially when they
are graceful or beautiful, that we are not
very severe or even accurate judges of the
abstract intellectual quality of their talk.
But a woman cannot feel the indescribable
charm which wins us so easily, and I have
sometimes thought that a superior person
of your sex might be aware of certain deficiencies
in her sisters which men very readily
overlook. You tell me that you feel embarrassed
in the society of ladies, because
they know so little about the subjects which
interest you, and are astonished when you
speak about anything really worth attention.
On the other hand, you feel perfectly at ease
with men of ability and culture, and most at
your ease with men of the best ability and
the most eminent attainments. What you
complain of chiefly in women seems to be
their impatience of varieties of thought
which are unfamiliar to them, and their constant
preference for small topics.</p>

<p>It has long been felt by men that if women
could be more freely initiated into great subjects
the interest of general conversation
would be much increased. The difficulty appears
to lie in their instinctive habit of making
all questions personal questions. The etiquette
of society makes it quite impossible
for men to speak to ladies in the manner
which would be intellectually most profitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
to them. We may not teach because it is
pedantic, and we may not contradict, because
it is rude. Most of the great subjects are
conventionally held to be closed, so that it is
a sin against good taste to discuss them. In
every house the ladies have a set of fixed
convictions of some kind, which it is not polite
in any man to appear to doubt. The consequence
of these conventional rules is that
women live in an atmosphere of acquiescence
which makes them intolerant of anything like
bold and original thinking on important subjects.
But as the mind always requires free
play of some kind, when all the great subjects
are forbidden it will use its activity in playing
about little ones.</p>

<p>For my part I hardly think it desirable for
any of us to be incessantly coping with great
subjects, and the ladies are right in taking a
lively interest in the small events around
them. But even the small events would have
a deeper interest if they were seen in their
true relations to the great currents of European
thought and action. It is probably the
ignorance of these relations which, more than
the smallness of the topics themselves, makes
feminine talk fatiguing to you. Very small
things indeed have an interest when exhibited
in relation to larger, as men of science are
continually demonstrating. I have been taking
note lately of the talk that goes on around
me, and I find that when it is shallow and
wearisome it is always because the facts mentioned
bear no reference to any central or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
governing idea, and do not illustrate anything.
Conversation is interesting in proportion to
the originality of the central ideas which
serve as pivots, and the fitness of the little
facts and observations which are contributed
by the talkers. For instance, if people happened
to be talking about rats, and some one
informed you that he had seen a rat last week,
that would be quite uninteresting: but you
would listen with greater attention if he said;
&ldquo;The other night, as I was going up stairs
very late, I followed a very fine rat who was
going up stairs too, and he was not in the
least hurried, but stopped after every two or
three steps to have a look at me and my candle.
He was very prettily marked about the
face and tail, so I concluded that he was not
a common rat, but probably a lemming. Two
nights afterwards I met him again, and this
time he seemed almost to know me, for he
quietly made room for me as I passed. Very
likely he might be easily tamed.&rdquo; This is interesting,
because, though the fact narrated
is still trifling, it illustrates animal character.</p>

<p>If you will kindly pardon an &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;
of this subject, as a preacher would
call it, I might add that an intellectual lady
like yourself might, perhaps, do better to
raise the tone of the feminine talk around
her than to withdraw from it in weariness.
There are always, in every circle, a few superior
persons who, either from natural diffidence,
or because they are not very rich, or
because they are too young, suffer themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
to be entirely overwhelmed by the established
mediocrity around them. What they need
is a leader, a deliverer. Is it not in your
power to render services of this kind? Could
you not select from the younger ladies whom
you habitually meet, a few who, like yourself,
feel bored by the dulness or triviality of what
you describe as the current feminine conversation?
There is often a painful shyness
which prevents people of real ability from
using it for the advantage of others, and this
shyness is nowhere so common as in England,
especially provincial England. It feels the
want of a hardy example. A lady who
talked really well would no doubt run some
risk of being rather unpleasantly isolated at
first, but surely, if she tried, she might ultimately
find accomplices. You could do much,
to begin with, by recommending high-toned
literature, and gradually awakening an interest
in what is truly worth attention. It
seems lamentable that every cultivated woman
should be forced out of the society of
her own sex, and made to depend upon ours
for conversation of that kind which is an absolute
necessity to the intellectual. The truth
is, that women so displaced never appear
altogether happy. And culture costs so much
downright hard work, that it ought not to be
paid for by any suffering beyond those toils
which are its fair and natural price.

<h3>LETTER VIII.</h3>

<h5>TO A LADY OF HIGH CULTURE.</h5>

<p class="pro">Greatest misfortune in the intellectual life of women&mdash;They do
not hear truth&mdash;Men disguise their thoughts for women&mdash;Cream
and curaçoa&mdash;Probable permanence of the desire
to please women&mdash;Most truth in cultivated society&mdash;Hopes
from the increase of culture.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I think</span> that the greatest misfortune in the
intellectual life of women is that they do not
hear the truth from men.</p>

<p>All men in cultivated society say to women
as much as possible that which they may be
supposed to wish to hear, and women are so
much accustomed to this that they can
scarcely hear without resentment an expression
of opinion which takes no account of their
personal and private feeling. The consideration
for the feelings of women gives an agreeable
tone to society, but it is fatal to the severity
of truth. Observe a man of the world
whose opinions are well known to you,&mdash;notice
the little pause before he speaks to a lady.
During that little pause he is turning over
what he has to say, so as to present it in the
manner that will please her best; and you
may be sure that the integrity of truth will
suffer in the process. If we compare what we
know of the man with that which the lady
hears from him, we perceive the immense disadvantages
of her position. He ascertains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
what will please her, and that is what he administers.
He professes to take a deep interest
in things which he does not care for in the
least, and he passes lightly over subjects and
events which he knows to be of the most momentous
importance to the world. The lady
spends an hour more agreeably than if she
heard opinions which would irritate, and prognostics
which would alarm her, but she has
missed an opportunity for culture, she has
been confirmed in feminine illusions. If this
happened only from time to time, the effect
would not tell so much on the mental constitution;
but it is incessant, it is continual.
Men disguise their thoughts for women as if
to venture into the feminine world were as
dangerous as travelling in Arabia, or as if the
thoughts themselves were criminal.</p>

<p>There appeared two or three years ago in
<i>Punch</i> a clever drawing which might have
served as an illustration to this subject. A
fashionable doctor was visiting a lady in Belgravia
who complained that she suffered from
debility. Cod-liver oil being repugnant to her
taste, the agreeable doctor, wise in his generation,
blandly suggested as an effective substitute
a mixture of cream and curaçoa.
What that intelligent man did for his patient&rsquo;s
physical constitution, all men of politeness do
for the intellectual constitution of ladies. Instead
of administering the truth which would
strengthen, though unpalatable, they administer
intellectual cream and curaçoa.</p>

<p>The primary cause of this tendency to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
what is most pleasing to women is likely to be
as permanent as the distinction of sex itself.
It springs directly from sexual feelings, it is
hereditary and instinctive. Men will never
talk to women with that rough frankness
which they use between themselves. Conversation
between the sexes will always be partially
insincere. Still I think that the more
women are respected, the more men will desire
to be approved by them for what they are
in reality, and the less they will care for approval
which is obtained by dissimulation. It
may be observed already that, in the most intellectual
society of great capitals, men are
considerably more outspoken before women
than they are in the provincial middle-classes.
Where women have most culture, men are
most open and sincere. Indeed, the highest
culture has a direct tendency to command sincerity
in others, both because it is tolerant of
variety in opinion, and because it is so penetrating
that dissimulation is felt to be of no
use. By the side of an uncultivated woman,
a man feels that if he says anything different
from what she has been accustomed to she
will take offence, whilst if he says anything
beyond the narrow range of her information
he will make her cold and uncomfortable.
The most honest of men, in such a position,
finds it necessary to be very cautious, and can
scarcely avoid a little insincerity. But with
a woman of culture equal to his own, these
causes for apprehension have no existence,
and he can safely be more himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span> </p>

<p>These considerations lead me to hope that
as culture becomes more general women will
hear truth more frequently. Whenever this
comes to pass, it will be, to them, an immense
intellectual gain.</p>

<h3>LETTER IX.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG MAN OF THE MIDDLE CLASS, WELL
EDUCATED, WHO COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS
DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO LIVE AGREEABLY WITH
HIS MOTHER, A PERSON OF SOMEWHAT AUTHORITATIVE
DISPOSITION, BUT UNEDUCATED.</h5>

<p class="pro">A sort of misunderstanding common in modern households&mdash;Intolerance
of inaccuracy&mdash;A false position&mdash;A lady not
easily intimidated&mdash;Difficulty of arguing when you have to
teach&mdash;Instance about the American War&mdash;The best course
in discussion with ladies&mdash;Women spoilt by non-contradiction&mdash;They
make all questions personal&mdash;The strength of
their feelings&mdash;Their indifference to matters of fact.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> been thinking a good deal, and seriously,
since we last met, about the subject of
our conversation, which though a painful one
is not to be timidly avoided. The degree of
unhappiness in your little household, which
ought to be one of the pleasantest of households,
yet which, as you confided to me, is
overshadowed by a continual misunderstanding,
is, I fear, very common indeed at the
present day. It is only by great forbearance,
and great skill, that any household in which
persons of very different degrees of culture
have to live together on terms of equality,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
can be maintained in perfect peace; and neither
the art nor the forbearance is naturally
an attribute of youth. A man whose scholarly
attainments were equal to your own,
and whose experience of men and women
was wider, could no doubt offer you counsel
both wise and practical, yet I can hardly say
that I should like you better if you followed
it. I cannot blame you for having the natural
characteristics of your years, an honest
love of the best truth that you have attained
to, an intolerance of inaccuracy on all subjects,
a simple faith in the possibility of teaching
others, even elderly ladies, when they
happen to know less than yourself. All these
characteristics are in themselves blameless;
and yet in your case, and in thousands of
other similar cases, they often bring clouds
of storm and trial upon houses which, in a
less rapidly progressive century than our own,
might have been blessed with uninterrupted
peace. The truth is, that you are in a false
position relatively to your mother, and your
mother is in a false position relatively to you.
She expects deference, and deference is
scarcely compatible with contradiction; certainly,
if there be contradiction at all, it must
be very rare, very careful, and very delicate.
You, on the other hand, although no doubt
full of respect and affection for your mother
in your heart, cannot hear her authoritatively
enunciating anything that you know to be
erroneous, without feeling irresistibly urged
to set her right. She is rather a talkative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
lady; she does not like to hear a conversation
going forward without taking a part in it, and
rather an important part, so that whatever
subject is talked about in her presence, that
subject she will talk about also. Even before
specialists your mother has an independence
of opinion, and a degree of faith in her own
conclusions, which would be admirable if
they were founded upon right reason and a
careful study of the subject. Medical men,
and even lawyers, do not intimidate her; she
is convinced that she knows more about disease
than the physician, and more about legal
business than an old attorney. In theology
no parson can approach her; but here a woman
may consider herself on her own ground,
as theology is the speciality of women.</p>

<p>All this puts you out of patience, and it is
intelligible that, for a young gentleman of intellectual
habits and somewhat ardent temperament
like yourself, it must be at times
rather trying to have an <span class="sc">Authority</span> at hand
ever ready to settle all questions in a decisive
manner. To you I have no counsel to offer
but that of unconditional submission. You
have the weakness to enter into arguments
when to sustain them you must assume the
part of a teacher. In arguing with a person
already well-informed upon the subject in
dispute, you may politely refer to knowledge
which he already possesses, but when he does
not possess the knowledge you cannot argue
with him; you must first teach him, you
must become didactic, and therefore odious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
I remember a great scene which took place
between you and your mother concerning the
American War. It was brought on by a too
precise answer of yours relatively to your
friend B., who had emigrated to America.
You mother asked to what part of America
B. had emigrated, and you answered, &ldquo;The
Argentine Republic.&rdquo; A shade of displeasure
clouded your mother&rsquo;s countenance, because
she did not know where the Argentine Republic
might be, and betrayed it by her manner.
You imprudently added that it was in South
America. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know very well,&rdquo; she
answered; &ldquo;there was a great battle there
during the American War. It is well your
friend was not there under Jefferson Davis.&rdquo;
Now, permit me to observe, my estimable
young friend, that this was what the French
call a fine opportunity for holding your
tongue, but your missed it. Fired with an
enthusiasm for truth (always dangerous to
the peace of families), you began to explain
to the good lady that the Argentine Republic,
though in South America, was not one of
the Southern States of the Union. This led
to a scene of which I was the embarrassed
and unwilling witness. Your mother vehemently
affirmed that all the Southern States
had been under Jefferson Davis, that she
knew the fact perfectly, that it had always
been known to every one during the war, and
that, consequently, as the Argentine Republic
was in South America, the Argentine Republic
had been under Jefferson Davis. Rapidly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>
warming with this discussion, your
mother &ldquo;supposed that you would deny next
that there had ever been such a thing as a
war between the North and the South.&rdquo;
Then you, in your turn, lost temper, and you
fetched an atlas for the purpose of explaining
that the southern division of the continent
of America was not the southern half of the
United States. You were landed, as people
always are landed when they prosecute an
argument with the ignorant, in the thankless
office of the schoolmaster. You were actually
trying to give your mother a lesson in geography!
She was not grateful to you for
your didactic attentions. She glanced at the
book as people glance at an offered dish
which they dislike. She does not understand
maps; the representation of places in geographical
topography has never been quite
clear to her. Your little geographical lecture
irritated, but did not inform; it clouded the
countenance, but did not illuminate the understanding.
The distinction between South
America and the Southern States is not easy
to the non-analytic mind under any circumstances,
but when <i>amour propre</i> is involved
it becomes impossible.</p>

<p>I believe that the best course in discussions
of this kind with ladies is simply to say <i>once</i>
what is true, for the acquittal of your own
conscience, but after that to remain silent on
that topic, leaving the last word to the lady,
who will probably simply re-affirm what she
has already said. For example, in the discussion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
about the Argentine Republic, your
proper course would have been to say first,
firmly, that the territory in question was not
a part of the seceded States and had never
been in the Union, with a brief and decided
geographical explanation. Your mother
would not have been convinced by this, and
would probably have had the last word, but
the matter would have ended there. Another
friend of mine, who is in a position very like
your own, goes a step farther, and is determined
to agree with his mother-in-law in
everything. He always assents to her propositions.
She is a Frenchwoman, and has
been accustomed to use <i>Algérie</i> and <i>Afrique</i>
as convertible terms. Somebody spoke of the
Cape of Good Hope as being in Africa.
&ldquo;Then it belongs to France, as Africa belongs
to France.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oui, chère mère,&rdquo; he answered,
in his usual formula; &ldquo;vous avez raison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He alluded to this afterwards when we were
alone together. &ldquo;I was foolish enough some
years since,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to argue with my <i>belle
mère</i> and try to teach her little things from
time to time, but it kept her in a state of
chronic ill-humor and led to no good; it
spoiled her temper, and it did not improve
her mind. But since I have adopted the plan
of perpetual assent we get on charmingly.
Whatever she affirms I assent to at once, and
all is well. My friends are in the secret, and
so no contradictory truth disturbs our amiable
tranquillity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A system of this kind spoils women completely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
and makes the least contradiction intolerable
to them. It is better that they
should at least have the opportunity of hearing
truth, though no attempt need be made
to force it upon them. The position of ladies
of the generation which preceded ours is in
many respects a very trying one, and we do
not always adequately realize it. A lady like
your mother, who never really went through
any intellectual discipline, who has no notion
of intellectual accuracy in anything, is
compelled by the irresistible feminine instinct
to engage her strongest feelings in every discussion
that arises. A woman can rarely detach
her mind from questions of persons to
apply it to questions of fact. She does not
think simply, &ldquo;Is that true of such a thing?&rdquo;
but she thinks, &ldquo;Does he love me or respect
me?&rdquo; The facts about the Argentine Republic
and the American War were probably
quite indifferent to your mother; but your
opposition to what she had asserted seemed
to her a failure in affection, and your attempt
to teach her a failure in respect. This feeling
in women is far from being wholly egoistic.
They refer everything to persons, but not necessarily
to their own persons. Whatever you
affirm as a fact, they find means of interpreting
as loyalty or disloyalty to some person
whom they either venerate or love, to the
head of religion, or of the State, or of the
family. Hence it is always dangerous to enter
upon intellectual discussion of any kind
with women, for you are almost certain to offend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
them by setting aside the sentiments of
veneration, affection, love, which they have
in great strength, in order to reach accuracy
in matters of fact, which they neither have
nor care for.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is one of the privileges of authorship to
have correspondents in the most widely different
positions, and by means of their frank
and friendly letters (usually much more frank
than any oral communication) to gain a singularly
accurate insight into the working of
circumstances on the human intellect and
character. The same post that brought me
your last letter brought news about another
of my friends whose lot has been a striking
contrast to your own.<a name="FnAnchor_8" id="FnAnchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
Let me dwell upon this contrast for a few
minutes. All the sunshine appears to have
been on your side, and all the shadow on his.
Born of highly cultivated parents, in the
highest rank in England under royalty, you
have lived from the beginning amongst the
most efficient aids to culture, and Nature has
so endowed you that, instead of becoming indifferent
to these things from familiarity,
you have learned to value them more and
more in every successive year. The plainest
statement of your advantages would sound
like an extract from one of Disraeli&rsquo;s
novels. Your father&rsquo;s principal castle is situated
amongst the finest scenery in Britain,
and his palace in London is filled with masterpieces
of art. Wherever you have lived you
have been surrounded by good literature and
cultivated friends. Your health is steadily
robust, you can travel wherever you choose,
and all the benefits of all the capitals of
Europe belong to you as much as to their own
citizens. In all these gifts and opportunities
there is but one evil&mdash;the bewilderment of
their multiplicity.</p>

<p>My other correspondent has been less fortunately
situated. &ldquo;I began school,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;when six years old, was taken from it at
eleven and sent to the mines to earn a little
towards my own support. I continued there
till fourteen, when through an unlucky incident
I was made a hopeless cripple. At that
day I was earning the noble sum of eightpence
per day, quite as much as any boy of that age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
got in the lead mines. I suffered much for
two years; after that, became much easier,
but my legs were quite useless, and have continued
so up to the present time. The right
thigh-bone is decayed, has not got worse these
nine years; therefore I conclude that I may
live&mdash;say another thirty years. I should <i>like</i>,
at all events, for life <i>is</i> sweet even at this
cost; not but what I could die quietly enough,
I dare say. I have not been idle these
years....&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Here permit me to introduce a parenthesis.
He certainly had <i>not</i> been idle. He had educated
himself up to such a point that he could
really appreciate both literature and art, and
had attained some genuine skill in both. His
letters to me were the letters of a cultivated
gentleman, and he used invariably to insert
little pen-sketches, which were done with a
light and refined hand.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do anything almost in bed&mdash;except
getting up. I am now twenty-two years old.
My father was a miner, but is now unable to
work. I have only one brother working, and
we are about a dozen of us; consequently we
are not in the most flourishing circumstances,
but a friend has put it in my power to learn
to etch. I have got the tools and your handbook
on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These extracts are from his first letter.
Afterwards he wrote me others which made
me feel awed and humbled by the manly
cheerfulness with which he bore a lot so
dreary, and by the firmness of resolution he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
showed in his pursuits. He could not quit
his bed, but that was not the worst; he could
not even sit up in bed, and yet he contrived,
I know not how, both to write and draw and
etch on copper, managing the plaguy chemicals,
and even printing his own proofs. His
bed was on wheels, on a sort of light iron carriage,
and he saw nature out-of-doors. All
the gladness of physical activity was completely
blotted out of his existence, and in
that respect his prospects were without hope.
And still he said that &ldquo;life was sweet.&rdquo; O
marvel of all marvels, how <i>could</i> that life be
sweet!</p>

<p>Aided by a beautiful patience and resignation
the lamp of the mind burned with a
steady brightness, fed by his daily studies.
In the winters, however, the diseased limb
gave him prolonged agony, and in the autumn
of 1872, to avoid the months of torture
that lay before him, he had himself put in
the railway and sent off, in his bed, to Edinburgh,
sleeping in a waiting-room on the
way. There was no one to attend him, but
he trusted, not vainly, to the humanity of
strangers. Just about the same time your
lordship went northwards also, with many
friends, to enjoy the noble scenery, and the
excitement of noble sport. My poor cripple
got to Edinburgh, got a glimpse of Scott&rsquo;s
monument and the Athenian pillars, and submitted
himself to the surgeons. They rendered
him the best of services, for they ended
his pains forever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span> </p>

<p>So I am to get no more of those wonderfully
brave and cheerful letters that were written
from the little bed on wheels. I miss
them for the lessons they quite unconsciously
conveyed. He fancied that he was the learner,
poor lad! and I the teacher, whereas it
was altogether the other way. He made me
feel what a blessing it is, even from the
purely intellectual point of view, to be able
to get out of bed after the night&rsquo;s rest, and
go from one room to another. He made me
understand the value of every liberty and
every power whilst at the same time he
taught me to bear more patiently every limit,
and inconvenience, and restriction.</p>

<p>In comparing his letters with yours I have
been struck by one reflection predominantly,
which is, the entire absence of class-sentiment
in both of you. Nobody, not in the secret,
could guess that one set of letters came
from a palace and the other set from a poor
miner&rsquo;s cottage; and even to me, who do not
see the habitations except by an effort of the
memory or imagination, there is nothing to
recall the immensity of the social distance
that separated my two friendly and welcome
correspondents. It is clear, of course, that
one of them had enjoyed greater advantages
than the other, but neither wrote from the
point of view which marks his caste or class.
It was my habit to write to you, and to him,
exactly in the same tone, yet this was not felt
to be unsuitable by either.</p>

<p>Is it not that the love and pursuit of culture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
lead each of us out of his class, and
that class-views of any kind, whether of the
aristocracy, or of the middle class, or of the
people, inevitably narrow the mind and hinder
it from receiving pure truth? Have you
ever known any person who lived habitually
in the notions of a caste, high or low, without
incapacitating himself in a greater or less
degree for breadth and delicacy of perception?
It seems to me that the largest and
best minds, although they have been born and
nurtured in this caste or that, and may continue
to conform externally to its customs,
always emancipate themselves from it intellectually,
and arrive at a sort of neutral region,
where the light is colorless, and clear,
and equal, like plain daylight out of doors.
So soon as we attain the forgetfulness of self,
and become absorbed in our pursuits for their
own sakes, the feeling of caste drops off from
us. It was not a mark of culture in Tycho
Brahe, but rather of the imperfections of his
culture, that he felt so strongly the difficulty
of conciliating scientific pursuits with the
obligations of noble birth, and began his public
discourses on astronomy by telling his
audience that the work was ill-suited to his
social position&mdash;hesitating, too, even about
authorship from a dread of social degradation.
And to take an instance from the opposite
extreme of human society, Robert
Burns betrayed the same imperfection of
culture in his dedication to the members of
the Caledonian Hunt, when he spoke of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>
&ldquo;honest rusticity,&rdquo; and told the gentlefolks
that he was &ldquo;bred to the plough, and independent.&rdquo;
Both of these men had been unfavorably
situated for the highest culture,
the one by the ignorance of his epoch the
other by the ignorance of his class; hence
this uneasiness about themselves and their
social position. Shelley said of Byron, &ldquo;The
canker of aristocracy wants to be cut out;&rdquo;
and he did not say this from the point of
view of a democrat, for Shelley was not precisely
a democrat, but from, the broadly human
point of view, on which the finest intellects
like to take their stand. Shelley perceived
that Byron&rsquo;s aristocracy narrowed
him, and made his sympathies less catholic
than they might have been, nor can there be
any doubt of the accuracy of this estimate of
Shelley&rsquo;s; if a doubt existed it would be removed
by Byron&rsquo;s alternative for a poet,
&ldquo;solitude, or high life.&rdquo; Another man of
genius, whose loss we have recently deplored,
was narrowed by his antipathy to the aristocratic
spirit, though it is necessary to add,
in justice, that it did not prevent him from
valuing the friendship of noblemen whom he
esteemed. The works of Charles Dickens
would have been more accurate as pictures of
English life, certainly more comprehensively
accurate, if he could have felt for the aristocracy
that hearty and loving sympathy which
he felt for the middle classes and the people.
But the narrowness of Dickens is more excusable
than that of Byron, because a kindly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
heart more easily enters into the feelings of
those whom it can often pity than of those
who appear to be lifted above pity (though
this is nothing but an appearance) and also
because it is the habit of aristocracies to repel
such sympathy by their manners, which the
poor do not.</p>

<p>I have often thought that a sign of aristocratic
narrowness in many English authors,
including some of the most popular authors
of the day, is the way they speak of shopkeepers.
This may be due to simple ignorance;
but if so, it is ignorance that might be
easily avoided. Happily for our convenience
there are a great many shopkeepers in England,
so that there is no lack of the materials
for study; but our novelists appear to consider
this important class of Englishmen as
unworthy of any patient and serious portraiture.
You may remember Mr. Anthony Trollope&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson,&rdquo;
which appeared in the <i>Cornhill
Magazine</i>, under Thackeray&rsquo;s editorship.
That was an extreme instance of the way the
class is treated in our literature; and then in
poetry we have some disdainful verses of Mr.
Tennyson&rsquo;s. It may be presumed that there
is material for grave and respectful treatment
of this extensive class, but our poets
and novelists do not seem to have discovered,
or sought to discover, the secret of that treatment.
The intensity of the prejudices of
caste prevents them from seeing any possibility
of true gentlemanhood in a draper or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
grocer, and blinds them to the æsthetic
beauty or grandeur which may be as perfectly
compatible with what is disdainfully
called &ldquo;counter-jumping&rdquo; as it is admitted
to be with the jumping of five-barred
gates.</p>

<p>The same caste prejudices have often kept
the mass of the upper classes in ignorance
of most valuable and important branches of
knowledge. The poor have been ignorant,
yet never proud of their ignorance; the ignorance
that men are proud of belongs to
caste always, not always to what we should
call an aristocratic caste, but to the caste-feeling
in one class or another. The pride of
the feudal baron in being totally illiterate
amounted to self-exclusion from all intellectual
culture, and we may still find living instances
of partial self-exclusion from culture,
of which pride is the only motive. There are
people who pass their time in what are considered
amusements (that do not amuse), because
it seems to them a more gentlemanly
sort of life than the devotion to some great
and worthy pursuit which would have given
the keenest zest and relish to their whole existence
(besides making them useful members
of society, which they are not), but which
happens to be tabooed for them by the prejudices
of their caste. There are many studies,
in themselves noble and useful, that a man of
good family cannot follow with the earnestness
and the sacrifice of time necessary to
success in them, without incurring the disapprobation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
of his friends. If this disapprobation
were visited on the breaker of caste-regulations
because he neglected some other
culture, there would still be something reasonable
in it; but this is not the case. The caste-regulation
forbids the most honorable and
instructive labor when it does not forbid the
most unprofitable idleness, the most utter
throwing away of valuable time and faculty.
Tycho Brahe feared to lose caste in becoming
the most illustrious astronomer of his time;
but he would have had no such apprehension,
nor any ground for such apprehension, if
instead of being impelled to noble work by a
high intellectual instinct, he had been impelled
by meaner passions to unlimited self-indulgence.
Even, in our own day these
prejudices are still strong enough, or have
been until very lately, to keep our upper
classes in great darkness about natural
knowledge of all kinds, and about its application
to the arts of life. How few gentlemen
have been taught to draw accurately, and
how few are accurately acquainted with the
great practical inventions of the age! The
caste-sentiment does not, in these days, keep
them ignorant of literature, but it keeps them
ignorant of <i>things</i>. A friend who had a
strong constructive and experimental turn,
told me that, as a rule, he found gentlemen
less capable of entering into his ideas than
common joiners and blacksmiths, because
these humble workmen, from their habit of
dealing with matter, had acquired some experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
of its nature. For my own part, I
have often been amazed by the difficulty of
making something clear to a classically educated
gentleman which any intelligent mechanic
would have seen to the bottom, and all
round, after five or six minutes of explanation.
There is a certain French nobleman
whose ignorance I have frequent opportunities
of fathoming, always with fresh astonishment
at the depths of it, and I declare that he
knows no more about the properties of stone,
and timber, and metal, than if he were a
cherub in the clouds of heaven!</p>

<p>But there is something in caste-sentiment
even more prejudicial to culture than ignorance
itself, and that is the affectation of
strong preferences for certain branches of
knowledge in which people are not seriously
interested. There is nothing which people
will not pretend to like, if a liking for it is
supposed to be one of the marks and indications
of gentility. There has been an immense
amount of this kind of affectation in
regard to classical scholarship, and we know
for a certainty that it <i>is</i> affectation whenever
people are loud in their praise of classical
authors whom they never take the trouble
to read. It may have happened to you, as
it has happened to me from time to time,
to hear men affirm the absolute necessity of
classical reading to distinction of thought
and manner, and yet to be aware at the same
time, from close observation of their habits,
that those very men entirely neglected the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
sources of that culture in which they professed
such earnest faith. The explanation
is, that as classical accomplishments are considered
to be one of the evidences of gentility,
whoever speaks loudly in their favor affirms
that he has the tastes and preferences of a
gentleman. It is like professing the fashionable
religion, or belonging to an aristocratic
shade of opinion in politics. I have not a
doubt that all affectations of this kind are injurious
to genuine culture, for genuine culture
requires sincerity of interest before
everything, and the fashionable affectations,
so far from attracting sincere men to the departments
of learning which happen to be <i>à
la mode</i>, positively drive them away, just as
many have become Nonconformists because
the established religion was considered necessary
to gentility, who might have remained
contented with its ordinances as a simple discipline
for their souls.</p>

<p>I dislike the interference of genteel notions
in our studies for another reason. They deprive
such culture as we may get from them,
of one of the most precious results of culture,
the enlargement of our sympathy for others.
If we encourage ourselves in the pride of
scholarly caste, so far as to imagine that we
who have made Latin verses are above comparison
with all who have never exercised
their ingenuity in that particular way, we are
not likely to give due and serious attention to
the ideas of people whom we are pleased to
consider uneducated; and yet it may happen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span>
that these people are sometimes our intellectual
superiors, and that their ideas concern us
very closely. But this is only half the evil.
The consciousness of our contempt embitters
the feelings of men in other castes, and prevents
them from accepting our guidance
when it might be of the greatest practical
utility to them. I may mention Robert
Burns as an instance of a man of genius who
would have been happier and more fortunate
if he had felt no barrier of separation
between himself and the culture of his time.
His poetry is as good rustic poetry as the best
that has come down to us from antiquity, and
instead of feeling towards the poets of times
past the kind of soreness which a parvenu
feels towards families of ancient descent, he
ought rather to have rejoiced in the consciousness
that he was their true and legitimate
successor, as the clergy of an authentic
Church feel themselves to be successors and
representatives of saints and apostles who are
gathered to their everlasting rest. But poor
Burns knew that in an age when what is
called scholarship gave all who had acquired
it a right to look down upon poets who had
only genius as the illegitimate offspring of
nature, his position had not that solidity
which belonged to the scholarly caste, and the
result was a perpetual uneasiness which broke
out in frequent defiance.</p>

<p>It was the influence of caste that made
Burns write in this way, and how unjust it
was every modern reader knows. The great
majority of poets have been well-educated
men, and instead of ganging into college like
stirks and coming out like asses, they have,
as a rule, improved their poetic faculty by an
acquaintance with the masterpieces of their
art. Yet Burns is not to be blamed for this injustice;
he sneered at Greek because Greek
was the mark of a disdainful and exclusive
caste, but he never sneered at French or Italian.
He had no soreness against culture for
its own sake; it was the pride of caste that
galled him.</p>

<p>How surely the wonderful class-instinct
guided the aristocracy to the kind of learning
likely to be the most effectual barrier against
fellowship with the mercantile classes and the
people! The uselessness of Greek in industry
and commerce was a guarantee that those
who had to earn their bread would never find
time to master it, and even the strange difficult
look of the alphabet (though in reality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
the alphabet was a gate of gossamer), ensured
a degree of awful veneration for those initiated
into its mysteries. Then the habit our
forefathers had of quoting Latin and Greek
to keep the ignorant in their places, was a
strong defensive weapon of their caste, and
they used it without scruple. Every year removes
this passion for exclusiveness farther
and farther into the past; every year makes
learning of every kind less available as the
armor of a class, and less to be relied upon as
a means of social advancement and consideration.
Indeed, we have already reached a condition
which is drawing back many members
of the aristocracy to a state of feeling about
intellectual culture resembling that of their
forefathers in the middle ages. The old barbarian
feeling has revived of late, a feeling
which (if it were self-conscious enough) might
find expression in some such words as
these:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not by learning and genius that we
can hold the highest place, but by the dazzling
exhibition of external splendor in those
costly pleasures which are the plainest evidence
of our power. Let us have beautiful
equipages on the land, beautiful yachts upon
the sea; let our recreations be public and
expensive, that the people may not easily
lose sight of us, and may know that there is
a gulf of difference between our life and
theirs. Why should we toil at books that
the poorest students read, we who have
lordly pastimes for every month in the year?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
To be able to revel immensely in pleasures
which those below us taste rarely or not at all,
this is the best evidence of our superiority.
So let us take them magnificently, like English
princes and lords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even the invention of railways has produced
the unforeseen result of a return in
the direction of barbarism. If there is one
thing which distinguishes civilization it is
fixity of residence; and it is essential to the
tranquil following of serious intellectual purposes
that the student should remain for
many months of the year in his own library
or laboratory, surrounded by all his implements
of culture. But there are people of the
highest rank in the England of to-day whose
existence is as much nomadic as that of Red
Indians in the reserved territories of North
America. You cannot ascertain their whereabouts
without consulting the most recent
newspaper. Their life may be quite accurately
described as a return, on a scale of unprecedented
splendor and comfort, to the life
of tribes in that stage of human development
which is known as the period of the chase.
They migrate from one hunting-ground to
another as the diminution of the game impels
them. Their residences, vast and substantial
as they are, serve only as tents and wigwams.
The existence of a monk in the cloister, of a
prisoner in a fortress, is more favorable to the
intellect than theirs.</p>

<p>And yet notwithstanding these re-appearances
of the savage nature at the very summit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
of modern civilization, the life of a great
English nobleman of to-day commands so
much of what the intellectual know to be
truly desirable, that it seems as if only a little
firmness of resolution were needed to make
all advantages his own. Surrounded by
every aid, and having all gates open, he sees
the paths of knowledge converging towards
him like railways to some rich central city.
He has but to choose his route, and travel
along it with the least possible hindrance
from every kind of friction, in the society of
the best companions, and served by the most
perfectly trained attendants. Might not our
lords be like those brilliant peers who shone
like intellectual stars around the throne of
Elizabeth, and our ladies like that great lady
of whom said a learned Italian, &ldquo;che non vi
aveva altra dama al mondo che la pareggiasse
nella cognizione delle arti e nella notizia delle
scienze e delle lingue,&rdquo; wherefore he called
her boldly, in the enthusiasm of his admiration,
&ldquo;<i>grande anfitrite, Diana nume della
terra!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">All</span> you say against the narrowness of the
aristocratic spirit is true and to the point; but
I think that you and your party are apt to
confound together two states of feeling which
are essentially distinct from each other.
There is an illiberal spirit of aristocracy, and
there is also a liberal one. The illiberal spirit
does not desire to improve itself, having a full
and firm belief in its own absolute perfection;
its sole anxiety is to exclude others, to draw
a circular line, the smaller the better, provided
always that it gets inside and can keep
the millions out. We see this spirit, not only
in reference to birth, but in even fuller activity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
with regard to education and employment&mdash;in
the preference for certain schools and
colleges, for class reasons, without regard to
the quality of the teaching&mdash;in the contempt
for all professions but two or three, without
regard to the inherent baseness or nobility of
the work that has to be done in them: so that
the question asked by persons of this temper
is not whether a man has been well trained
in his youth, but if he has been to Eton and
Oxford; not whether he is honorably laborious
in his manhood, but whether he belongs to the
Bar, or the Army, or the Church. This spirit
is evil in its influence, because it substitutes
external limitations for the realities of the intellect
and the soul, and makes those realities
themselves of no account wherever its traditions
prevail. This spirit cares nothing for
culture, nothing for excellence, nothing for
the superiorities that make men truly great;
all it cares for is to have reserved seats in the
great assemblage of the world. Whatever
you do, in fairness and honesty, against this
evil and inhuman spirit of aristocracy, the
best minds of this age approve; but there is
another spirit of aristocracy which does not
always receive the fairest treatment at your
hands, and which ought to be resolutely defended
against you.</p>

<p>There is really, in nature, such a thing as
high life. There is really, in nature, a difference
between the life of a gentleman who has
culture, and fine bodily health, and independence,
and the life of a Sheffield dry-grinder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
who cannot have any one of these three
things. It is a good and not a bad sign of the
state of popular intelligence when the people
does not wilfully shut its eyes to the differences
of condition amongst men, and when
those who have the opportunity of leading
what is truly the high life accept its discipline
joyfully and have a just pride in keeping
themselves up to their ideal. A life of
health, of sound morality, of disinterested intellectual
activity, of freedom from petty
cares, <i>is</i> higher than a life of disease, and
vice, and stupidity, and sordid anxiety. I
maintain that it is right and wise in a nation
to set before itself the highest attainable ideal
of human life as the existence of the complete
gentleman, and that an envious democracy,
instead of rendering a service to itself, does
exactly the contrary when it cannot endure
and will not tolerate the presence of high-spirited
gentlemen in the State. There are
things in this world that it is right to hate,
that we are the better for hating with all our
hearts; and one of the things that I hate
most, and with most reason, is the narrow
class-spirit when it sets itself against the great
interests of mankind. It is odious in the narrow-minded,
pompous, selfish, pitiless aristocrat
who thinks that the sons of the people
were made by Almighty God to be his lackeys
and their daughters to be his mistresses;
it is odious also, to the full as odious, in the
narrow-minded, envious democrat who cannot
bear to see any elegance of living, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
grace of manner, or culture of mind above
the range of his own capacity or his own
purse.</p>

<p>Let me recommend to your consideration
the following words, written by one young
nobleman about another young nobleman,
and reminding us, as we much need to be reminded,
that life may be not only honest
and vigorous, but also noble and beautiful.
Robert Lytton says of Julian Fane&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was, I think, the most graceful and
accomplished gentleman of the generation he
adorned, and by this generation, at least, appropriate
place should be reserved for the
memory of a man in whose character the most
universal sympathy with all the intellectual
culture of his age was united to a refinement
of social form, and a perfection of personal
grace, which, in spite of all its intellectual culture,
the age is sadly in want of. There is an
artistry of life as well as of literature, and the
perfect knighthood of Sidney is no less precious
to the world than the genius of Spenser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is just this &ldquo;perfect knighthood&rdquo; that an
envious democracy sneers at and puts down.
I do not say that all democracies are necessarily
envious, but they often are so, especially
when they first assert themselves, and whilst
in that temper they are very willing to ostracize
gentlemen, or compel them to adopt bad
manners. I have some hopes that the democracies
of the future may be taught by authors
and artists to appreciate natural gentlemanhood;
but so far as we know them hitherto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
they seem intolerant of dignity, and disposed
to attribute it (very unjustly) to individual
self-conceit. The personages most popular in
democratic countries are often remarkably
deficient in dignity, and liked the better for
the want of it, whilst if on the positive side
they can display occasional coarseness they
become more popular still. Then I should
say, that although democratic feeling raises
the lower classes and increases their self-respect,
which is indeed one of the greatest imaginable
benefits to a nation, it has a tendency
to fix one uniform type of behavior and of
thought as the sole type in conformity with
what is accepted for &ldquo;common sense,&rdquo; and
that type can scarcely, in the nature of things,
be a very elevated one. I have been much
struck, in France, by the prevalence of what
may be not inaccurately defined as the commercial
traveller type, even in classes where
you would scarcely expect to meet with it.
One little descriptive anecdote will illustrate
what I mean. Having been invited to a stag-hunt
in the Côte d&rsquo;Or, I sat down to <i>déjeuner</i>
with the sportsmen in a good country-house
or château (it was an old place with four
towers), and in the midst of the meal in came
a man smoking a cigar. After a bow to the
ladies he declined to eat anything, and took a
chair a little apart, but just opposite me. He
resumed his hat and went on smoking with a
<i>sans-gêne</i> that rather surprised me under the
circumstances. He put one arm on the side-board:
the hand hung down, and I perceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span>
that it was dirty (so was the shirt), and that
the nails had edges of ebony. On his chin
there was a black stubble of two days&rsquo; growth.
He talked very loudly, and his dress and manners
were exactly those of a bagman just arrived
at his inn. Who and what could the
man be? I learned afterwards that he had
begun life as a distinguished pupil of the <i>Ecole
Polytechnique</i>, that since then he had distinguished
himself as an officer of artillery and
had won the Legion of Honor on the field of
battle, that he belonged to one of the principal
families in the neighborhood, and had
nearly 2000<i>l.</i> a year from landed property.</p>

<p>Now, it may be a good thing for the roughs
at the bottom of the social scale to level up to
the bagman-ideal, but it does seem rather a
pity (does it not?) that a born gentleman of
more than common bravery and ability should
level <i>down</i> to it. And it is here that lies the
principle objection to democracy from the
point of view of culture, that its notion of life
and manners is a uniform notion, not admitting
much variety of classes, and not allowing
the high development of graceful and accomplished
humanity in any class which an
aristocracy does at least encourage in one
class, though it may be numerically a small
class. I have not forgotten what Saint-Simon
and La Bruyère have testified about the ignorance
of the old noblesse. Saint-Simon
said that they were fit for nothing but fighting,
and only qualified for promotion even in
the army by seniority; that the rest of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
time was passed in &ldquo;the most deadly uselessness,
the consequence of their indolence and
distaste for all instruction.&rdquo; I am sure that
my modern artillery captain, <span class="correction" title="amended from notwithstand">notwithstanding</span>
his bad manners, <i>knew</i> more than any of
his forefathers; but where was his &ldquo;perfect
knighthood?&rdquo; And we easily forget &ldquo;how
much talent runs into manners,&rdquo; as Emerson
says. From the artistic and poetical point of
view, behavior is an expression of knowledge
and taste and feeling in combination, as clear
and legible as literature or painting, so that
when the behavior is coarse and unbecoming
we know that the perceptions cannot be delicate,
whatever may have been learned at
school. When Dr. Arnold travelled on the
Continent, nothing struck him more than the
absence of gentlemen. &ldquo;We see no gentlemen
anywhere,&rdquo; he writes from Italy. From
France he writes: &ldquo;Again I have been struck
with the total absence of all gentlemen, and
of all persons of the education and feelings
of gentlemen.&rdquo; Now, although Dr. Arnold
spoke merely from the experience of a tourist,
and was perhaps not quite competent to
judge of Frenchmen and Italians otherwise
than from externals, still there was much
truth in his observation. It was not quite
absolutely true. I have known two or three
Italian officers, and one Savoyard nobleman,
and a Frenchman here and there, who were
as perfect gentlemen as any to be found in
England, but they were isolated like poets,
and were in fact poets in behavior and self
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
discipline. The plain truth is, that there is
no distinct class in France maintaining good
manners as a tradition common to all its
members; and this seems to be the inevitable
defect of a democracy. It may be observed,
further, that language itself is defiled by the
vulgarity of the popular taste; that expressions
are used continually, even by the upper
middle class, which it is impossible to print,
and which are too grossly indecent to find a
place even in the dictionaries; that respectable
men, having become insensible to the
meaning of these expressions from hearing
them used without intention, employ them
constantly from habit, as they decorate their
speech with oaths, whilst only purists refrain
from them altogether.</p>

<p>An aristocracy may be very narrow and
intolerant, but it can only exclude from its
own pale, whereas when a democracy is intolerant
it excludes from all human intercourse.
Our own aristocracy, as a class,
rejects Dissenters, and artists, and men of
science, but they flourish quite happily outside
of it. Now try to picture to yourself a
great democracy having the same prejudices,
who could get out of the democracy? All
aristocracies are intolerant with reference, I
will not say to religion, but, more accurately,
with reference to the outward forms of religion,
and yet this aristocratic intolerance has
not prevented the development of religious
liberty, because the lower classes were not
strictly bound by the customs of the nobility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
and gentry. The unwritten law appears to
be that members of an aristocracy shall conform
either to what is actually the State
Church or to what has been the State Church
at some former period of the national history.
Although England is a Protestant country,
an English gentleman does not lose caste when
he joins the Roman Catholic communion;
but he loses caste when he becomes a Dissenter.
The influence of this caste-law in
keeping the upper classes within the Churches
of England and of Rome has no doubt been
very considerable, but its influence on the
nation generally has been incomparably less
considerable than that of some equally decided
social rule in the entire mind of a
democracy. Had this rule of conformity to
the religion of the State been that of the English
democracy, religious liberty would have
been extinguished throughout the length and
breadth of England. I say that the customs
and convictions of a democracy are more
dangerous to intellectual liberty than those
of an aristocracy, because, in matters of custom,
the gentry rule only within their own
park-palings, whereas the people, when power
resides with them, rule wherever the breezes
blow. A democracy that dislikes refinement
and good manners can drive men of culture
into solitude, and make morbid hermits of
the very persons who ought to be the lights
and leaders of humanity. It can cut short
the traditions of good-breeding, the traditions
of polite learning, the traditions of thoughtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
leisure, and reduce the various national types
of character to one type, that of the <i>commis-voyageur</i>.
All men of refined sentiment in
modern France lament the want of elevation
in the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. They read nothing, they
learn nothing, they think of nothing but
money and the satisfaction of their appetites.
There are exceptions, of course, but the tone
of the class is mean and low, and devoid of
natural dignity or noble aspiration. Their
ignorance passes belief, and is accompanied
by an absolute self-satisfaction. &ldquo;La fin de
la bourgeoisie,&rdquo; says an eminent French
author, &ldquo;commence parcequ&rsquo;elle a les sentiments
de la populace. Je ne vois pas qu&rsquo;elle
lise d&rsquo;autres journaux, qu&rsquo;elle se régale d&rsquo;une
musique différente, qu&rsquo;elle ait des plaisirs
plus élevés. Chez l&rsquo;une comme chez l&rsquo;autre,
c&rsquo;est le même amour de l&rsquo;argent, le même
respect du fait accompli, le même besoin
d&rsquo;idoles pour les détruire, la même haine de
toute supériorité, le même esprit de dénigrement,
la même crasse ignorance!&rdquo; M. Renan
also complains that during the Second Empire
the country sank deeper and deeper into vulgarity,
forgetting its past history and its
noble enthusiasms. &ldquo;Talk to the peasant, to
the socialist of the International, of France,
of her past history, of her genius, he will not
understand you. Military honor seems madness
to him; the taste for great things, the
glory of the mind, are vain dreams; money
spent for art and science is money thrown
away foolishly. Such is the provincial spirit.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
And if this is the provincial spirit, what is the
spirit of the metropolitan democracy? Is it
not clearly known to us by its acts? It had
the opportunity, under the Commune, of
showing the world how tenderly it cared for
the monuments of national history, how anxious
it was for the preservation of noble architecture,
of great libraries, of pictures that can
never be replaced. Whatever may have been
our illusions about the character of the Parisian
democracy, we know it very accurately
now. To say that it is brutal would be an
inadequate use of language, for the brutes are
only indifferent to history and civilization,
not hostile to them. So far as it is possible
for us to understand the temper of that democracy,
it appears to cherish an active and
intense hatred for every conceivable kind of
superiority, and an instinctive eagerness to
abolish the past; or, as that is not possible,
since the past will always <i>have been</i> in spite
of it, then at least to efface all visible memorials
and destroy the bequests of all preceding
generations. If any one had affirmed,
before the fall of Louis Napoleon, that the
democratic spirit was capable of setting fire
to the Louvre and the national archives and
libraries, of deliberately planning the destruction
of all those magnificent edifices,
ecclesiastical and civil, which were the glory
of France and the delight of Europe, we
should have attributed such an assertion to
the exaggerations of reactionary fears. But
since the year 1870 we do not speculate about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
the democratic temper in its intensest expression;
we have seen it at work, and we know
it. We know that every beautiful building,
every precious manuscript and picture, has
to be protected against the noxious swarm of
Communards as a sea-jetty against the Pholas
and the Teredo.</p>

<p>Compare this temper with that of a Marquis
of Hertford, a Duke of Devonshire, a
Duc de Luynes! True guardians of the means
of culture, these men have given splendid
hospitality to the great authors and artists of
past times, by keeping their works for the future
with tender and reverent care. Nor has
this function of high stewardship ever been
more nobly exercised than it is to-day by that
true knight and gentleman, Sir Richard Wallace.
Think of the difference between this
great-hearted guardian of priceless treasures,
keeping them for the people, for civilization,
and a base-spirited Communard setting fire
to the library of the Louvre.</p>

<p>The ultra-democratic spirit is hostile to culture,
from its hatred of all delicate and romantic
sentiment, from its scorn of the tenderer
and finer feelings of our nature, and especially
from its brutish incapacity to comprehend
the needs of the higher life. If it had
its way we should be compelled by public
opinion to cast all the records of our ancestors,
and the shields they wore in battle, into
the foul waters of an eternal Lethe. The intolerance
of the sentiment of birth, that noble
sentiment which has animated so many hearts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
with heroism, and urged them to deeds of
honor, associated as it is with a cynical disbelief
in the existence of female virtue,<a name="FnAnchor_9" id="FnAnchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> is
one of the commonest signs of this evil spirit
of detraction. It is closely connected with an
ungrateful indifference towards all that our
forefathers have done to make civilization
possible for us. Now, although the intellectual
spirit studies the past critically, and does
not accept history as a legend is accepted by
the credulous, still the intellectual spirit has
a deep respect for all that is noble in the past,
and would preserve the record of it forever.
Can you not imagine, have you not actually
seen, the heir of some ancient house who
shares to the full the culture and aspirations
of the age in which we live, and who nevertheless
preserves, with pious reverence, the
towers his forefathers built on the ancestral
earth, and the oaks they planted, and the
shields that were carved on the tombs where
the knights and their ladies rest? Be sure
that a right understanding of the present is
compatible with a right and reverent understanding
of the past, and that, although we
may closely question history and tradition, no
longer with childlike faith, still the spirit of
true culture would never efface their vestiges.
It was not Michelet, not Renan, not Hugo,
who set fire to the Palace of Justice and imperilled
the Sainte-Chapelle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
And yet, notwithstanding all these vices
and excesses of the democratic spirit, notwithstanding
the meanness of the middle
classes and the violence of the mob, there is
one all-powerful reason why our best hopes
for the liberal culture of the intellect are centred
in the democratic idea. The reason is,
that aristocracies think too much of persons
and positions to weigh facts and opinions
justly. In an aristocratic society it is thought
unbecoming to state your views in their full
force in the presence of any social superior.
If you state them at all you must soften them
to suit the occasion, or you will be a sinner
against good-breeding. Observe how timid
and acquiescent the ordinary Englishman becomes
in the presence of a lord. No right-minded
person likes to be thought impudent,
and where the tone of society refers everything
to position, you are considered impudent
when you forget your station. But
what has my station to do with the truths the
intellect perceives, that lie entirely outside of
me? From the intellectual point of view, it
is a necessary virtue to forget your station, to
forget yourself entirely, and to think of the
subject only, in a manner perfectly disinterested.
Anonymous journalism was a device
to escape from that continual reference to the
rank and fortune of the speaker which is an
inveterate habit in all aristocratic communities.
A young man without title or estate
knows that he would not be listened to in the
presence of his social superiors, so he holds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
his tongue in society and relieves himself by
an article in the <i>Times</i>. The anonymous
newspapers and reviews are a necessity in an
aristocratic community, for they are the only
means of attracting attention to facts and
opinions without attracting it to yourself, the
only way of escaping the personal question,
&ldquo;Who and what are you, that you venture
to speak so plainly, and where is your stake
in the country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The democratic idea, by its theoretic equality
amongst men, affords an almost complete
relief from this impediment to intellectual
conversation. The theory of equality is good,
because it negatives the interference of rank
and wealth in matters that appertain to the
intellect or to the moral sense. It may even
go one step farther with advantage, and ignore
intellectual authority also. The perfection
of the intellectual spirit is the entire forgetfulness
of persons, in the application of the
whole power of the mind to things, and phenomena,
and ideas. Not to mind whether the
speaker is of noble or humble birth, rich or
poor; this indeed is much, but we ought to attain
a like indifference to the authority of the
most splendid reputation. &ldquo;Every great advance
in natural knowledge,&rdquo; says Professor
Huxley, &ldquo;has involved the absolute rejection
of authority, the cherishing of the keenest
scepticism, the annihilation of the spirit of
blind faith; and the most ardent votary of
science holds his firmest convictions, not because
the men he most venerates hold them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
not because their verity is testified by portents
and wonders, but because his experience
teaches him that whenever he chooses to
bring these convictions into contact with
their primary source, Nature&mdash;whenever he
thinks fit to test them by appealing to experiment
and to observation&mdash;Nature will confirm
them.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="full" />


<h3 class="pt3">LETTER I.</h3>

<h5>TO A LADY WHO DOUBTED THE REALITY OF INTELLECTUAL
FRIENDSHIPS.</h5>

<p class="pro">That intellectual friendships are in their nature temporary,
when there is no basis of feeling to support them&mdash;Their
freshness soon disappears&mdash;Danger of satiety&mdash;Temporary
acquaintances&mdash;Succession in friendships&mdash;Free communication
of intellectual results&mdash;Friendships between ripe
and immature men&mdash;Rembrandt and Hoogstraten&mdash;Tradition
transmitted through these friendships.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I heartily</span> agree with you so far as this,
that intellectual relations will not sustain
friendship for very long, unless there is also
some basis of feeling to sustain it. And still
there is a certain reality in the friendships of
the intellect whilst they last, and they are remembered
gratefully for their profit when in
the course of nature they have ceased. We
may wisely contract them, and blamelessly
dissolve them when the occasion that created
them has gone by. They are like business
partnerships, contracted from motives of interest,
and requiring integrity above all
things, with mutual respect and consideration,
yet not necessarily either affection or the semblance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span>
of it. Since the motive of the intellectual
existence is the desire to ascertain and
communicate truth, a sort of positive and
negative electricity immediately establishes
itself between those who want to know and
those who desire to communicate their knowledge;
and the connection is mutually agreeable
until these two desires are satisfied.
When this happens, the connection naturally
ceases; but the memory of it usually leaves a
permanent feeling of good-will, and a permanent
disposition to render services of the same
order. This, in brief, is the whole philosophy
of the subject; but it may be observed farther,
that the purely intellectual intercourse
which often goes by the name of friendship
affords excellent opportunities for the formation
of real friendship, since it cannot be long
continued without revealing much of the
whole nature of the associates.</p>

<p>We do not easily exhaust the mind of another,
but we easily exhaust what is accessible
to us in his mind; and when we have done
this, the first benefit of intercourse is at an
end. Then comes a feeling of dulness and
disappointment, which is full of the bitterest
discouragement to the inexperienced. In maturer
life we are so well prepared for this that
it discourages us no longer. We know beforehand
that the freshness of the mind that was
new to us will rapidly wear away, that we
shall soon assimilate the fragment of it which
is all that ever can be made our own, so we
enjoy the freshness whilst it lasts, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>376</span>
even careful of it as a fruiterer is of the bloom
upon his grapes and plums. It may seem a
hard and worldly thing to say, but it appears
to me that a wise man might limit his intercourse
with others before there was any danger
of satiety, as it is wisdom in eating to rise
from table with an appetite. Certainly, if the
friends of our intellect live near enough for
us to anticipate no permanent separation by
mere distance, if we may expect to meet them
frequently, to have many opportunities for a
more thorough and searching exploration of
their minds, it is a wise policy not to exhaust
them all at once. With the chance acquaintances
we make in travelling, the case is altogether
different; and this is, no doubt, the
reason why men are so astonishingly communicative
when they never expect to see
each other any more. You feel an intense
curiosity about some temporary companion;
you make many guesses about him; and to
induce him to tell you as much as possible in
the short time you are likely to be together,
you win his confidence by a frankness that
would perhaps considerably surprise your
nearest neighbors and relations. This is due
to the shortness of the opportunity; but with
people who live in the same place, you will
proceed much more deliberately.</p>

<p>Whoever would remain regularly provided
with intellectual friends, ought to arrange a
succession of friendships, as gardeners do
with peas and strawberries, so that, whilst
some are fully ripe, others should be ripening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>
to replace them. This doctrine sounds like
blasphemy against friendship; but it is not
intended to apply to the sacred friendship of
the heart, which ought to be permanent like
marriage, only to the friendship of the head,
which is of the utmost utility to culture, yet
in its nature temporary. I know a distinguished
Englishman who is quite remarkable
for the talent with which he arranges his <span class="correction" title="amended from inintellectual">intellectual</span>
friendships, so as never to be dependent
on any one, but always sure of the intercourse
he needs, both now and in the future.
He will never be isolated, never without
some fresh and living interest in humanity.
It may seem to you that there is a lamentable
want of faith in this; and I grant
at once that a system of this kind does presuppose
the extinction of the boyish belief in
the permanence of human relations; still, it
indicates a large-minded confidence in the
value of human intercourse, an enjoyment of
the present, a hope for the future, and a right
appreciation of the past.</p>

<p>Nothing is more beautiful in the intellectual
life than the willingness of all cultivated people&mdash;unless
they happen to be accidentally soured
by circumstances that have made them
wretched&mdash;to communicate to others the results
of all their toil. It is true that they apparently
lose nothing by the process, and that
a rich man who gives some portion of his material
wealth exercises a greater self-denial;
still, when you consider that men of culture,
in teaching others, abandon something of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
relative superiority, and often voluntarily incur
the sacrifice of what is most precious to
them, namely, their time, I think you will admit
that their readiness in this kind of generosity
is one of the finest characteristics of
highly-developed humanity. Of all intellectual
friendships, none are so beautiful as those
which subsist between old and ripe men and
their younger brethren in science, or literature,
or art. It is by these private friendships,
even more than by public performance, that
the tradition of sound thinking and great doing
is perpetuated from age to age. Hoogstraten,
who was a pupil of Rembrandt, asked
him many questions, which the great master
answered thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Try to put well in practice
what you already know; in so doing you will,
in good time, discover the hidden things which
you now inquire about.&rdquo; That answer of
Rembrandt&rsquo;s is typical of the maturest teaching.
How truly friendly it is; how full of
encouragement; how kind in its admission
that the younger artist <i>did</i> already know
something worth putting into practice; and
yet, at the same time, how judicious in its reserve!
Few of us have been so exceptionally
unfortunate as not to find, in our own age,
some experienced friend who has helped us by
precious counsel, never to be forgotten. We
cannot render it in kind; but perhaps in the
fulness of time it may become our noblest duty
to aid another as we have ourselves been aided,
and to transmit to him an invaluable treasure,
the tradition of the intellectual life.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED MUCH IN
FASHIONABLE SOCIETY.</h5>

<p class="pro">Certain dangers to the intellectual life&mdash;Difficult to resist the
influences of society&mdash;Gilding&mdash;Fashionable education&mdash;Affectations
of knowledge&mdash;Not easy to ascertain what
people really know&mdash;Value of real knowledge diminished&mdash;Some
good effects of affectations&mdash;Their bad effect on
workers&mdash;Skill in amusements.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> kind of life which you have been leading
for the last three or four years will always
be valuable to you as a past experience, but if
the intellectual ambition you confess to me is
quite serious, I would venture to suggest that
there are certain dangers in the continuation
of your present existence if altogether uninterrupted.
Pray do not suspect me of any
narrow prejudice against human intercourse,
or of any wish to make a hermit of you before
your time, but believe that the few observations
I have to make are grounded simply
on the desire that your career should be entirely
satisfactory to your own maturer judgment,
when you will look back upon it after
many years.</p>

<p>An intellectual man may go into general
society quite safely if only he can resist its
influence upon his serious work; but such resistance
is difficult in maturity and impossible
in youth.</p>

<p>The sort of influence most to be dreaded is
this. Society is, and must be, based upon appearances,
and not upon the deepest realities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>
It requires some degree of reality to produce
the appearance, but not a substantial reality.
Gilding is the perfect type of what Society
requires. A certain quantity of gold is necessary
for the work of the gilder, but a very
small quantity, and skill in applying the
metal so as to cover a large surface, is of
greater consequence than the weight of the
metal itself. The mind of a fashionable person
is a carefully gilded mind.</p>

<p>Consider fashionable education. Society
imperatively requires an outside knowledge
of many things; not permitting the frank
confession of ignorance, whilst it is yet satisfied
with a degree of knowledge differing
only from avowed ignorance in permitting
you to be less sincere. All young ladies,
whether gifted by nature with any musical
talent or not, are compelled to say that they
have learned to play upon the piano; all
young gentlemen are compelled to affect to
know Latin. In the same way the public
opinion of Society compels its members to
pretend to know and appreciate the masterpieces
of literature and art. There is, in
truth, so much compulsion of this kind that it
is not easy to ascertain what people do really
know and care about until they admit you
into their confidence.</p>

<p>The inevitable effect of these affectations is
to diminish the value, in Society, of genuine
knowledge and accomplishment of all kinds.
I know a man who is a Latin scholar; he is
one of the few moderns who have really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
learned Latin; but in fashionable society this
brings him no distinction, because we are all
supposed to know Latin, and the true scholar,
when he appears, cannot be distinguished
from the multitude of fashionable pretenders.
I know another man who can draw; there
are not many men, even amongst artists,
who can draw soundly; yet in fashionable society
he does not get the serious sort of respect
which he deserves, because fashionable
people believe that drawing is an accomplishment
generally attainable by young ladies
and communicable by governesses. I have
no wish to insinuate that Society is wrong, in
requiring a certain pretence to education in
various subjects, and a certain affectation of
interest in masterpieces, for these pretences
and affectations do serve to deliver it from
the darkness of a quite absolute ignorance.
A society of fashionable people who think it
necessary to be able to talk superficially
about the labors of men really belonging to
the intellectual class, is always sure to be
much better informed than a Society such as
that of the French peasantry, for example,
where nobody is expected to know anything.
It is well for Society itself that it should profess
a deep respect for classical learning, for
the great modern poets and painters, for scientific
discoverers, even though the majority
of its members do not seriously care about
them. The pretension itself requires a certain
degree of knowledge, as gilding requires
a certain quantity of gold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span> </p>

<p>The evil effects of these affectations may be
summed up in a sentence. They diminish
the apparent value of the realities which they
imitate, and they tend to weaken our enthusiasm
for those great realities, and our ardor in
the pursuit of them. The impression which
fashionable society produces upon a student
who has strength enough to resist it, is a
painful sense of isolation in his earnest work.
If he goes back to the work with courage undiminished,
he still clearly realizes&mdash;what it
would be better for him not to realize quite
so clearly&mdash;the uselessness of going beyond
fashionable standards, if he aims at social
success. And there is still another thing to be
said which concerns you just now very particularly.
Whoever leads the intellectual life
in earnest is sure on some points to fail in
strict obedience to the exigencies of fashionable
life, so that, if fashionable successes are
still dear to him, he will be constantly tempted
to make some such reflections as the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Here
am I, giving years and years
of labor to a pursuit which brings no external
reward, when half as much work would keep
me abreast of the society I live with, in everything
it really cares about. I know quite
well all that my learning is costing me.
Other men outshine me easily in social pleasures
and accomplishments. My skill at billiards
and on the moors is evidently declining,
and I cannot ride or drive so well as fellows
who do very little else. In fact I am becoming
an old muff, and all I have to show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
on the other side is a degree of scholarship
which only six men in Europe can appreciate,
and a speciality in natural science in which
my little discoveries are sure to be either anticipated
or left behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth is, that to succeed well in fashionable
society the higher intellectual attainments
are not so useful as distinguished skill
in those amusements which are the real <span class="correction" title="amended from busiof">business of</span>
the fashionable world. The three things
which tell best in your favor amongst young
gentlemen are to be an excellent shot, to ride
well to hounds, and to play billiards with
great skill. I wish to say nothing against any
of these accomplishments, having an especially
hearty admiration and respect for all
good horsemen, and considering the game of
billiards the most perfectly beautiful of games;
still, the fact remains that to do these things
as well as some young gentlemen do them, we
must devote the time which they devote, and
if we regularly give nine hours a day to graver
occupations, pray, how and where are we
to find it?</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED MUCH IN
FASHIONABLE SOCIETY.</h5>

<p class="pro">Some exceptional men may live alternately in different worlds&mdash;Instances&mdash;Differences
between the fashionable and the
intellectual spirit&mdash;Men sometimes made unfashionable by
special natural gifts&mdash;Sometimes by trifling external circumstances&mdash;Anecdote
of Ampère&mdash;He did not shine in society&mdash;His
wife&rsquo;s anxieties about his material wants&mdash;Apparent
contrast between Ampère and Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p><span class="sc">You</span> ask me why there should be any fundamental
incompatibility between the fashionable
and the intellectual lives. It seems to
you that the two might possibly be reconciled,
and you mention instances of men who attained
intellectual distinction without deserting
the fashionable world.</p>

<p>Yes, there <i>have</i> been a few examples of men
endowed with that overflow of energy which
permits the most opposite pursuits, and enables
its possessors to live, apparently, in two
worlds between which there is not any natural
affinity. A famous French novelist once
took the trouble to elaborate the portrait of a
lady who passed one half of her time in virtue
and churches, whilst she employed the other
half in the wildest adventures. In real life
I may allude to a distinguished English engraver,
who spent a fortnight over his plate
and a fortnight in some fashionable watering-place,
alternately, and who found this distribution
of his time not unfavorable to the elasticity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>385</span>
of his mind. Many hard-working Londoners,
who fairly deserve to be considered intellectual
men, pass their days in professional labor
and their evenings in fashionable society.
But in all instances of this kind the professional
work is serious enough, and regular
enough, to give a very substantial basis to the
life, so that the times of recreation are kept
daily subordinate by the very necessity of circumstances.
If you had a profession, and
were obliged to follow it in earnest six or eight
hours a day, the more Society amused you
the better. The danger in your case is that
your whole existence may take a fashionable
tone.</p>

<p>The <i>esprit</i> or tone of fashion differs from the
intellectual tone in ways which I will attempt
to define. Fashion is nothing more than the
temporary custom of rich and idle people who
make it their principal business to study the
external elegance of life. This custom incessantly
changes. If your habits of mind and
life change with it you are a fashionable person,
but if your habits of mind and life either
remain permanently fixed or follow some law
of your own individual nature, then you are
outside of fashion. The intellectual spirit is
remarkable for its independence of custom,
and therefore on many occasions it will clash
with the fashionable spirit. It does so most
frequently in the choice of pursuits, and in
the proportionate importance which the individual
student will (in his own case) assign to
his pursuits. The regulations of fashionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
life have fixed, at the least temporarily, the
degree of time and attention which a fashionable
person may devote to this thing or that.
The intellectual spirit ignores these regulations,
and devotes its possessor, or more accurately
its <i>possessed</i>, to the intellectual speciality
for which he has most aptitude, often
leaving him ignorant of what fashion has decided
to be essential. After living the intellectual
life for several years he will know too
much of one thing and too little of some other
things to be in conformity with the fashionable
ideal. For example, the fashionable ideal
of a gentleman requires classical scholarship,
but it is so difficult for artists and men of science
to be classical scholars also that in this
respect they are likely to fall short. I knew
a man who became unfashionable because he
had a genius for mechanics. He was always
about steam-engines, and, though a gentleman
by birth, associated from choice with men
who understood the science that chiefly interested
him, of which all fashionable people
were so profoundly ignorant that he habitually
kept out of their way. He, on his part,
neglected scholarship and literature and all
that &ldquo;artistry of life,&rdquo; as Mr. Robert Lytton
calls it, in which fashionable society excels.
Men are frequently driven into unfashionable
existence by the very force and vigor of their
own intellectual gifts, and sometimes by external
circumstances, apparently most trifling,
yet of infinite influence on human destiny.
There is a good instance of this in a letter from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
Ampère to his young wife, that &ldquo;Julie&rdquo; who
was lost to him so soon. &ldquo;I went to dine
yesterday at Madame Beauregard&rsquo;s with
hands blackened by a harmless drug which
stains the skin for three or four days. She declared
that it looked like manure, and left
the table, saying that she would dine when
I was at a distance. I promised not to return
there before my hands were white. Of
course I shall never enter the house again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here we have an instance of a man of science
who has temporarily disqualified himself
for polite society by an experiment in the
pursuit of knowledge. What do you think
of the vulgarity of Madame Beauregard? To
me it appears the perfect type of that <span class="correction" title="amended from pre-occupation">preoccupation</span>
about appearances which blinds the
genteel vulgar to the true nobility of life.
Were not Ampère&rsquo;s stained hands nobler
than many white ones? It is not necessary
for every intellectual worker to blacken his
fingers with chemicals, but a kind of rust
very frequently comes over him which ought
to be as readily forgiven, yet rarely is forgiven.
&ldquo;In his relations with the world,&rdquo;
writes the biographer of Ampère, &ldquo;the authority
of superiority disappeared. To this
the course of years brought no alternative.
Ampère become celebrated, laden with honorable
distinctions, the great Ampère! outside
the speculations of the intellect, was hesitating
and timid again, disquieted and troubled,
and more disposed to accord his confidence
to others than to himself.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span> </p>

<p>Intellectual pursuits did not qualify Ampère,
they do not qualify any one, for success in
fashionable society. To succeed in the world
you ought to be <i>of</i> the world, so as to share
the things which interest it without too wide
a deviation from the prevalent current of
your thoughts. Its passing interests, its temporary
customs, its transient phases of sentiment
and opinion, ought to be for the moment
your own interests, your own feelings and
opinions. A mind absorbed as Ampère&rsquo;s was
in the contemplation and elucidation of the
unchangeable laws of nature, is too much
fixed upon the permanent to adapt itself
naturally to these ever-varying estimates.
He did not easily speak the world&rsquo;s lighter
language, he could not move with its mobility.
Such men forget even what they eat and
what they put on; Ampère&rsquo;s young wife was
in constant anxiety, whilst the pair were
separated by the severity of their fate, as
to the sufficiency of his diet and the decency
of his appearance. One day she writes
to him to mind not to go out in his shabby old
coat, and in the same letter she entreats him
to purchase a bottle of wine, so that when he
took no milk or broth he would find it, and
when it was all drunk she tells him to buy
another bottle. Afterwards she asks him
whether he makes a good fire, and if he has
any chairs in his room. In another letter she
inquires if his bed is comfortable, and in
another she tells him to mind about his acids,
for he has burnt holes in his blue stockings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span>
Again, she begs him to try to have a passably
decent appearance, because that will give
pleasure to his poor wife. He answers, to
tranquillize her, that he does not burn his
things now, and that he makes chemical experiments
only in his old breeches with his
gray coat and his waistcoat of greenish velvet.
But one day he is forced to confess that she
must send him new trousers if he is to appear
before MM. Delambre and Villars. He
&ldquo;does not know what to do,&rdquo; his best breeches
still smell of turpentine, and, having wished
to put on trousers to go to the Society of Emulation,
he saw the hole which Barrat fancied
he had mended become bigger than ever, so
that it showed the piece of different cloth
which he had sown under it. He adds that
his wife will be afraid that he will spoil his
&ldquo;<i>beau pantalon</i>,&rdquo; but he promises to send it
back to her as clean as when he received it.
How different is all this from that watchful
care about externals which marks the man of
fashion! Ampère was quite a young man
then, still almost a bridegroom, yet he is already
so absorbed in the intellectual life as to
forget appearances utterly, except when Julie,
with feminine watchfulness, writes to recall
them to his mind. I am not defending
or advocating this carelessness. It is better
to be neat and tidy than to go in holes and
patches; but I desire to insist upon the radical
difference between the fashionable spirit
and the intellectual spirit. And this difference,
which shows itself in these external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
things, is not less evident in the clothing or
preparation of the mind. Ampère&rsquo;s intellect,
great and noble as it was, could scarcely
be considered more suitable for <i>le grand
monde</i> than the breeches that smelt of turpentine,
or the trousers made ragged by
aquafortis.</p>

<p>A splendid contrast, as to tailoring, was
our own dear Oliver Goldsmith, who displayed
himself in those wonderful velvet
coats and satin small-clothes from Mr. Filby&rsquo;s,
which are more famous than the finest
garments ever worn by prince or peer. Who
does not remember that bloom-colored coat
which the ablest painters have studiously immortalized,
made by John Filby, at the Harrow,
in Water Lane (best advertised of tailors!),
and that charming blue velvet suit,
which Mr. Filby was never paid for? Surely
a poet so splendid was fit for the career of
fashion! No, Oliver Goldsmith&rsquo;s velvet and
lace were the expression of a deep and painful
sense of personal unfitness. They were
the fine frame which is intended to pass off
an awkward and imperfect picture. There
was a quieter dignity in Johnson&rsquo;s threadbare
sleeves. Johnson, the most influential though
not the most elegant intellect of his time, is
grander in his neglect of fashion than Goldsmith
in his ruinous subservience. And if it
were permitted to me to speak of two or
three great geniuses who adorn the age in
which we ourselves are living, I might add
that they seem to follow the example of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span>
author of &ldquo;Rasselas&rdquo; rather than that of Mr.
Filby&rsquo;s illustrious customer. They remind
me of a good old squire who, from a fine sentiment
of duty, permitted the village artist
to do his worst upon him, and incurred thereby
this withering observation from his metropolitan
tailor: &ldquo;You are <i>covered</i>, sir, but
you are <i>not</i> dressed!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED MUCH IN
FASHIONABLE SOCIETY.</h5>

<p class="pro">Test of professions&mdash;Mobility of fashionable taste&mdash;Practical
service of an external deference to culture&mdash;Incompatibility
between fashionable and intellectual lives&mdash;What
each has to offer.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Your</span> polite, almost diplomatic answer to
my letter about fashionable society may be
not unfairly concentrated into some such paragraph
as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What grounds have I for concluding that
the professed tastes and opinions of Society
are in any degree insincere? May not society
be quite sincere in the preferences which it
professes, and are not the preferences themselves
almost always creditable to the good
taste and really advanced culture of the Society
which I suspect of a certain degree of
affectation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the sense of your letter, and in reply
to it I give you a simple but sure test. Is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
professed opinion carried out in practice,
when there are fair opportunities for practice?</p>

<p>Let us go so far as to examine a particular
instance. Your friends profess to appreciate
classical literature. Do they read it? Or, on
the other hand, do they confine themselves
to believing that it is a good thing for other
people to read it?</p>

<p>When I was a schoolboy, people told me
that the classical authors of antiquity were
eminently useful, and indeed absolutely necessary
to the culture of the human mind,
but I perceived that they did not read them.
So I have heard many people express great
respect for art and science, only they did not
go so far as to master any department of art
or science.</p>

<p>If you will apply this test to the professions
of what is especially called fashionable society
it is probable that you will arrive at the conclusions
of the minority, which I have endeavored
to express. You will find that the fashionable
world remains very contentedly outside
the true working intellectual life, and
does not really share either its labors or its
aspirations.</p>

<p>Another kind of evidence, which tells in the
same direction, is the mobility of fashionable
taste. At one time some studies are fashionable,
at another time these are neglected
and others have taken their place. You will
not find this fickleness in the true intellectual
world, which steadily pursues all its various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
studies, and keeps them well abreast, century
after century.</p>

<p>If I insist upon this distinction with reference
to you, do not accuse me of hostility even
to fashion itself. Fashion is one of the great
Divine institutions of human society, and the
best philosophy rebels against none of the authorities
that be, but studies and endeavors to
explain them. The external deference which
Society yields to culture is practically of great
service, although (I repeat the epithet) it is
<i>external</i>. The sort of good effect is in the intellectual
sphere what the good effect of a general
religious profession is in the moral sphere.
All fashionable society goes to church. Fashionable
religion differs from the religion of
Peter and Paul as fashionable science differs
from that of Humboldt and Arago, yet, notwithstanding
this difference, the profession of
religion is useful to Society as some restraint,
at least during one day out of seven, upon its
inveterate tendency to live exclusively for its
amusement. And if any soul happens to
come into existence in the fashionable world
which has the genuine religious nature, that
nature has a chance of developing itself, and
of finding ready to hand certain customs
which are favorable to its well-being. So it
is, though in quite a different direction, with
the esteem which Society professes for intellectual
pursuits. It is an esteem in great part
merely nominal, as fashionable Christianity is
nominal, and still it helps and favors the early
development of the genuine faculty where it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
exists. It is certainly a great help to us that
fashionable society, which has such a tremendous,
such an almost irresistible power for
good or evil, does not openly discourage our
pursuits, but on the contrary regards them
with great external deference and respect.
The recognition which Society has given to
artists has been wanting in frankness and in
promptitude, though even in this case much
may be said to excuse a sort of hesitation
rather than refusal which was attributable to
the strangeness and novelty of the artistic
caste in England; but Society has far more
than a generation professed a respect for literature
and erudition which has helped those
two branches of culture more effectually than
great subsidies of money. The exact truth
seems to be that Society is sincere in approving
our devotion to these pursuits, but is not
yet sufficiently interested in them to appreciate
them otherwise than from the outside, just
as a father and mother applaud their boys for
reading Thucydides, yet do not read him
themselves, either in the original or in a translation.</p>

<p>All that I care to insist upon is that there
is a degree of incompatibility between the
fashionable and the intellectual lives which
makes it necessary, at a certain time, to
choose one or the other as our own. There is
no hostility, there need not be any uncharitable
feeling on one side or the other, but there
must be a resolute choice between the two.
If you decide for the intellectual life, you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>
incur a definite loss to set against your gain.
Your existence may have calmer and profounder
satisfactions, but it will be less amusing,
and even in an appreciable degree less
<i>human</i>; less in harmony, I mean, with the
common instincts and feelings of humanity.
For the fashionable world, although decorated
by habits of expense, has enjoyment for
its object, and arrives at enjoyment by those
methods which the experience of generations
has proved to be most efficacious. Variety
of amusement, frequent change of scenery
and society, healthy exercise, pleasant occupation
of the mind without fatigue&mdash;these
things do indeed make existence agreeable to
human nature, and the science of living agreeably
is better understood in the fashionable
society of England than by laborious students
and <i>savans</i>. The life led by that society is
the true heaven of the natural man, who
likes to have frequent feasts and a hearty
appetite, who enjoys the varying spectacle
of wealth, and splendor, and pleasure, who
loves to watch, from the Olympus of his personal
ease, the curious results of labor in
which he takes no part, the interesting ingenuity
of the toiling world below. In exchange
for these varied pleasures of the spectator
the intellectual life can offer you but
one satisfaction, for all its promises are reducible
simply to this, that you shall come at
last, after infinite labor, into contact with
some great <i>reality</i>&mdash;that you shall know, and
do, in such sort that you will feel yourself on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
firm ground and be recognized&mdash;probably not
much applauded, but yet recognized&mdash;as a
fellow-laborer by other knowers and doers.
Before you come to this, most of your present
accomplishments will be abandoned by yourself
as unsatisfactory and insufficient, but one
or two of them will be turned to better account,
and will give you after many years a
tranquil self-respect, and, what is still rarer
and better, a very deep and earnest reverence
for the greatness which is above you. Severed
from the vanities of the Illusory, you will live
with the realities of knowledge, as one who
has quitted the painted scenery of the theatre
to listen by the eternal ocean or gaze at the
granite hills.</p>

<h3>LETTER V.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO KEPT ENTIRELY
OUT OF COMPANY.</h5>

<p class="pro">That Society which is frivolous in the mass contains individuals
who are not frivolous&mdash;A piece of the author&rsquo;s early
experience&mdash;Those who keep out of Society miss opportunities&mdash;People
talk about what they have in common&mdash;That
we ought to be tolerant of dulness&mdash;The loss to
Society if superior men all held aloof&mdash;Utility of the gifted
in general society&mdash;They ought not to submit to expulsion.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I willingly</span> concede all that you say against
fashionable society as a whole. It is, as you
say, frivolous, bent on amusement, incapable
of attention sufficiently prolonged to grasp
any serious subject, and liable both to confusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
and inaccuracy in the ideas which it
hastily forms or easily receives. You do
right, assuredly, not to let it waste your most
valuable hours, but I believe also that you do
wrong in keeping out of it altogether.</p>

<p>The society which seems so frivolous in
masses contains individual members who, if
you knew them better, would be able and
willing to render you the most efficient intellectual
help, and you miss this help by
restricting yourself exclusively to books.
Nothing can replace the conversation of living
men and women; not even the richest
literature can replace it.</p>

<p>Many years ago I was thrown by accident
amongst a certain society of Englishmen who,
when they were all together, never talked
about anything worth talking about. Their
general conversations were absolutely empty
and null, and I concluded, as young men so
easily conclude, that those twenty or thirty
gentlemen had not half a dozen ideas amongst
them. A little reflection might have reminded
me that my own talk was no better than
theirs, and consequently that there might be
others in the company who also knew more
and thought more than they expressed. I
found out, by accident, after awhile, that
some of these men had more than common
culture in various directions; one or two had
travelled far, and brought home the results of
much observation; one or two had read
largely, and with profit; more than one had
studied a science; five or six had seen a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
deal of the world. It was a youthful mistake
to conclude that, because their general conversation
was very dull, the men were dull
individually. The general conversations of
English society <i>are</i> dull; it is a national
characteristic. But the men themselves are
individually often very well informed, and
quite capable of imparting their information
to a single interested listener. The art is to
be that listener. Englishmen have the greatest
dread of producing themselves in the semi-publicity
of a general conversation, because
they fear that their special topics may not be
cared for by some of the persons present; but
if you can get one of them into a quiet corner
by himself, and humor his shyness with sufficient
delicacy and tact, he will disburden his
mind at last, and experience a relief in so
doing.</p>

<p>By keeping out of society altogether you
miss these precious opportunities. The wise
course is to mix as much with the world as
may be possible without withdrawing too
much time from your serious studies, but not
to expect anything valuable from the general
talk, which is nothing but a neutral medium
in which intelligences float and move as
yachts do in sea-water, and for which they
ought not to be held individually responsible.
The talk of Society answers its purpose if it
simply permits many different people to come
together without clashing, and the purpose
of its conventions is the avoidance of collision.
In England the small talk is heavy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>399</span>
like water; in France it is light as air; in
both countries it is a medium and no more.</p>

<p>Society talks, by preference, about amusements;
it does so because when people meet
for recreation they wish to relieve their
minds from serious cares, and also for the
practical reason that Society must talk about
what its members have in common, and their
amusements are more in common than their
work. As M. Thiers recommended the republican
form of government in France on the
ground that it was the form which divided
his countrymen least, so a polite and highly
civilized society chooses for the subject of
general conversation the topic which is
least likely to separate the different people
who are present. It almost always happens
that the best topic having this recommendation
is some species of amusement; since
amusements are easily learnt outside the business
of life, and we are all initiated into them
in youth.</p>

<p>For these reasons I think that we ought to
be extremely tolerant of the dulness or frivolity
which may seem to prevail in any numerous
company, and not to conclude too
hastily that the members of it are in any degree
more dull or frivolous than ourselves.
It is unfortunate, certainly, that the art of
general conversation is not so successfully
cultivated as it might be, and there are reasons
for believing that our posterity will surpass
us in this respect, because as culture increases
the spirit of toleration increases with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
it, so that the great questions of politics and
religion, in which all are interested, may be
discussed more safely than they could be at
the present day, by persons of different ways
of thinking. But even the sort of general
conversation we have now, poor as it may
seem, still sufficiently serves as a medium for
human intercourse, and permits us to meet
on a common ground where we may select at
leisure the agreeable or instructive friends
that our higher intellect needs, and without
whom the intellectual life is one of the ghastliest
of solitudes.</p>

<p>And now permit me to add a few observations
on another aspect of this subject, which
is not without its importance.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that every one of rather
more than ordinary capacity and culture were
to act as you yourself are acting, and withdraw
entirely from general society. Let us
leave out of consideration for the present the
loss to their private culture which would be
the consequence of missing every opportunity
for forming new intellectual friendships. Let
us consider, this time, what would be the
consequence to Society itself.</p>

<p>If all the cultivated men were withdrawn
from it, the general tone of Society would inevitably
descend much lower even than it is
at present; it would sink so low that the
whole national intellect would undergo a sure
and inevitable deterioration. It is plainly the
duty of men situated as you are, who have
been endowed by nature with superior faculties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
and who have enlarged them by the acquisition
of knowledge, to preserve Society by
their presence from an evil so surely prolific
of bad consequences. If Society is less narrow,
and selfish, and intolerant, and apathetic
than it used to be, it is because they who are
the salt of the earth have not disdained to
mix with its grosser and earthier elements.
All the improvement in public sentiment, and
the advancement in general knowledge which
have marked the course of recent generations,
are to be attributed to the wholesome influence
of men who could think and feel, and
who steadily exercised, often quite obscurely,
yet not the less usefully in their time and
place, the subtle but powerful attraction of the
greater mind over the less. Instead of complaining
that people are ignorant and frivolous,
we ought to go amongst them and lead
them to the higher life. &ldquo;I know not how it
is,&rdquo; said one in a dull circle to a more gifted
friend who entered it occasionally, &ldquo;when
we are left to ourselves we are all lamentably
stupid, but whenever you are kind enough to
come amongst us we all talk very much better,
and of things that are well worth talking
about.&rdquo; The gifted man is always welcome,
if only he will stoop to conquer, and forget
himself to give light and heat to others. The
low Philistinism of many a provincial town is
due mainly to the shy reserve of the one or
two superior men who fancy that they cannot
amalgamate with the common intellect of
the place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span> </p>

<p>Not only would I advocate a little patient
condescension, but even something of the
sturdier temper which will not be driven out.
Are the Philistines to have all the talk to
themselves forever; are they to rehearse
their stupid old platitudes without the least
fear of contradiction? How long, O Lord?
how long? Let us resolve that even in general
society they shall not eternally have
things their own way. Somebody ought to
have the courage to enlighten them even at
their own tables, and in the protecting presence
of their admiring wives and daughters.</p>

<p><span class="sc">You</span> cry to me <i>Væ solis!</i> and the cry seems
not the less loud and stirring that it comes in
the folds of a letter. Just at first it quite
startled and alarmed me, and made me
strangely dissatisfied with my life and work;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>
but farther reflection has been gradually reconciling
me ever since, and now I feel cheerful
again, and in a humor to answer you.</p>

<p><i>Woe unto him that is alone!</i> This has been
often said, but the studious recluse may answer,
<i>Woe unto him that is never alone and
cannot bear to be alone!</i></p>

<p>We need society, and we need solitude also,
as we need summer and winter, day and
night, exercise and rest. I thank heaven for
a thousand pleasant and profitable conversations
with acquaintances and friends; I thank
heaven also, and not less gratefully, for thousands
of sweet hours that have passed in solitary
thought or labor, under the silent
stars.</p>

<p>Society is necessary to give us our share
and place in the collective life of humanity,
but solitude is necessary to the maintenance
of the individual life. Society is to the individual
what travel and commerce are to a
nation; whilst solitude represents the home
life of the nation, during which it develops its
especial originality and genius.</p>

<p>The life of the perfect hermit, and that of
those persons who feel themselves nothing individually,
and have no existence but what
they receive from others, are alike imperfect
lives. The perfect life is like that of a ship of
war which has its own place in the fleet and
can share in its strength and discipline, but
can also go forth alone in the solitude of the
infinite sea. We ought to belong to Society,
to have our place in it, and yet to be capable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span>
of a complete individual existence outside of
it.</p>

<p>Which of the two is the grander, the ship
in the disciplined fleet, arranged in order of
battle, or the ship alone in the tempest, a
thousand miles from land? The truest grandeur
of the ship is neither in one nor the other,
but in the capacity for both. What would
that captain merit who either had not seamanship
enough to work under the eye of the admiral,
or else had not sufficient knowledge of
navigation to be trusted out of the range of
signals?</p>

<p>I value society for the abundance of ideas
that it brings before us, like carriages in a frequented
street; but I value solitude for sincerity
and peace, and for the better understanding
of the thoughts that are truly ours.
Only in solitude do we learn our inmost nature
and its needs. He who has lived for some
great space of existence apart from the tumult
of the world, has discovered the vanity of the
things for which he has no natural aptitude
or gift&mdash;their <i>relative</i> vanity, I mean, their
uselessness to himself, personally; and at the
same time he has learned what is truly precious
and good for him. Surely this is knowledge
of inestimable value to a man: surely it
is a great thing for any one in the bewildering
confusion of distracting toils and pleasures to
have found out the labor that he is most fit
for and the pleasures that satisfy him best.
Society so encourages us in affectations that
it scarcely leaves us a chance of knowing our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
own minds; but in solitude this knowledge
comes of itself, and delivers us from innumerable
vanities.</p>

<p>Montaigne tells us that at one time he bought
books from ostentation, but that afterwards
he bought only such books as he wanted for
his private reading. In the first of these conditions
of mind we may observe the influence
of society; in the second the effect of solitude.
The man of the world does not consult his own
intellectual needs, but considers the eyes of
his visitors; the solitary student takes his literature
as a lonely traveller takes food when
he is hungry, without reference to the ordered
courses of public hospitality.</p>

<p>It is a traditional habit of mankind to see
only the disadvantages of solitude, without
considering its compensations; but there are
great compensations, some of the greatest
being negative. The lonely man is lord of his
own hours and of his own purse; his days are
long and unbroken, he escapes from every
form of ostentation, and may live quite simply
and sincerely in great calm breadths of leisure.
I knew one who passed his summers in the
heart of a vast forest, in a common thatched
cottage with furniture of common deal, and
for this retreat he quitted very gladly a rich
fine house in the city. He wore nothing but
old clothes, read only a few old books, without
the least regard to the opinions of the
learned, and did not take in a newspaper.
On the wall of his habitation he inscribed with
a piece of charcoal a quotation from De Sénancour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span>
to this effect: &ldquo;In the world a man
lives in his own age; in solitude, in all the
ages.&rdquo; I observed in him the effects of a
lonely life, and he greatly aided my observations
by frankly communicating his experiences.
That solitude had become inexpressibly
dear to him, but he admitted one evil
consequence of it, which was an increasing unfitness
for ordinary society, though he cherished
a few tried friendships, and was grateful
to those who loved him and could enter
into his humor. He had acquired a horror of
towns and crowds, not from nervousness, but
because he felt imprisoned and impeded in his
thinking, which needed the depths of the
forest, the venerable trees, the communication
with primæval nature, from which he
drew a mysterious yet necessary nourishment
for the peculiar activity of his mind. I found
that his case answered very exactly to the
sentence he quoted from De Sénancour; he
lived less in his own age than others do, but
he had a fine compensation in a strangely
vivid understanding of other ages. Like De
Sénancour, he had a strong sense of the transitoriness
of what is transitory, and a passionate
preference for all that the human mind
conceives to be relatively or absolutely permanent.
This trait was very observable in
his talk about the peoples of antiquity, and in
the delight he took in dwelling rather upon
everything which they had in common with
ourselves than on those differences which are
more obvious to the modern spirit. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span>
temper was grave and earnest, but unfailingly
cheerful, and entirely free from any tendency
to bitterness. The habits of his life would have
been most unfavorable to the development of a
man of business, of a statesman, of a leader in
practical enterprise, but they were certainly
not unfavorable to the growth of a tranquil
and comprehensive intellect, capable of &ldquo;just
judgment and high-hearted patriotism.&rdquo; He
had not the spirit of the newspapers, he did
not live intensely in the present, but he had
the spirit which has animated great poets,
and saints, and sages, and far-seeing teachers
of humanity. Not in vain had he lived alone
with Nature, not in vain had he watched in
solemn twilights and witnessed many a dawn.
There is, there <i>is</i> a strength that comes to us
in solitude from that shadowy, awful Presence
that frivolous crowds repel!</p>

<p>Solitude may be and is sometimes deliberately
accepted or chosen, but far more frequently
men are driven into it by Nature and
by Fate. They go into solitude to escape the
sense of isolation which is always most intolerable
when there are many voices round us
in loud dissonance with our sincerest thought.
It is a great error to encourage in young people
the love of noble culture in the hope that
it may lead them more into what is called
good society. High culture always isolates,
always drives men out of their class and
makes it more difficult for them to share
naturally and easily the common class-life
around them. They seek the few companions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>408</span>
who can understand them, and when these
are not to be had within any traversable distance,
they sit and work alone. Very possibly
too, in some instances, a superior culture
may compel the possessor of it to hold opinions
too far in advance of the opinions prevalent
around him to be patiently listened to or
tolerated, and then he must either disguise
them, which is always highly distasteful to a
man of honor, or else submit to be treated as
an enemy to human welfare. Cultivated
people who live in London (their true home)
need never condemn themselves to solitude
from this cause, but in the provinces there
are many places where it is not easy for them
to live sociably without a degree of reserve
that is more wearisome than solitude itself.
And however much pains you take to keep
your culture well in the background, it always
makes you rather an object of suspicion
to people who have no culture. They perceive
that you are reserved, they know that
very much of what passes in your mind is a
mystery to them, and this feeling makes them
uneasy in your presence, even afraid of you,
and not indisposed to find a compensation for
this uncomfortable feeling in sarcasms behind
your back. Unless you are gifted with a
truly extraordinary power of conciliating
goodwill, you are not likely to get on happily,
for long together, with people who feel themselves
your inferiors. The very utmost skill
and caution will hardly avail to hide all your
modes of thought. Something of your higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>409</span>
philosophy will escape in an unguarded moment,
and give offence because it will seem
foolish or incomprehensible to your audience.
There is no safety for you but in a timely
withdrawal, either to a society that is prepared
to understand you, or else to a solitude
where your intellectual superiorities will
neither be a cause of irritation to others nor
of vexation to yourself.</p>

<p>Like all our instincts, the instinct of solitude
has its especial purpose, which appears
to be the protection of rare and delicate natures
from the commonplace world around
them. Though recluses are considered by
men of the world to be doomed to inevitable
incompetence, the fact is that many of them
have reached the highest distinction in intellectual
pursuits. If Shelley had not disliked
general society as he did, the originality of
his own living and thinking would have been
less complete; the influences of mediocre people,
who, of course, are always in the majority,
would have silently but surely operated
to the destruction of that unequalled and personal
delicacy of imagination to which we
owe what is inimitable in his poetry. In the
last year of his life, he said to Trelawny of
Mary, his second wife, &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t bear solitude,
nor I society&mdash;the quick coupled with
the dead.&rdquo; Here is a piteous prayer of his to
be delivered from a party that he dreaded:
&ldquo;Mary says she will have a party! There
are English singers here, the Sinclairs, and
she will ask them, and every one she or you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>410</span>
know. Oh the horror! For pity go to Mary
and intercede for me! I will submit to any
other species of torture than that of being
bored to death by idle ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo;
Again, he writes to Mary: &ldquo;My greatest delight
would be utterly to desert all human society.
I would retire with you and our child
to a solitary island in the sea; would build a
boat, and shut upon my retreat the flood-gates
of the world. I would read no reviews and
talk with no authors. If I dared trust my
imagination it would tell me that there are
one or two chosen companions beside yourself
whom I should desire. But to this I
would not listen; where two or three are
gathered together, the devil is among them.&rdquo;
At Marlow he knew little of his neighbors.
&ldquo;I am not wretch enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to tolerate
an acquaintance.&rdquo; Wordsworth and
Turner, if less systematic in their isolation,
were still solitary workers, and much of the
peculiar force and originality of their performance
is due to their independence of the
people about them. Painters are especial sufferers
from the visits of talkative people who
know little or nothing of the art they talk
about, and yet who have quite influence
enough to disturb the painter&rsquo;s mind by proving
to him that his noblest thoughts are surest
to be misunderstood. Men of science, too, find
solitude favorable to their peculiar work, because
it permits the concentration of their
powers during long periods of time. Newton
had a great repugnance to society, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>411</span>
to notoriety&mdash;a feeling which is different, and
in men of genius more rare. No one can
doubt, however, that Newton&rsquo;s great intellectual
achievements were due in some measure
to this peculiarity of his temper, which
permitted him to ripen them in the sustained
tranquillity necessary to difficult investigations.
Auguste Comte isolated himself not
only from preference but on system, and
whatever may have been the defects of his
remarkable mind, and the weakness of its
ultimate decay, it is certain that his amazing
command over vast masses of heterogeneous
material would have been incompatible with
any participation in the passing interests of
the world. Nothing in intellectual history
has ever exceeded the unshakable firmness
of purpose with which he dedicated his whole
being to the elaboration of the Positive philosophy.
He sacrificed everything to it&mdash;position,
time, health, and all the amusements
and opportunities of society. He
found that commonplace acquaintances disturbed
his work and interfered with his mastery
of it, so he resolutely renounced them.
Others have done great things in isolation
that was not of their own choosing, yet none
the less fruitful for them and for mankind.
It was not when Milton saw most of the
world, but in the forced retirement of a man
who had lost health and eyesight, and whose
party was hopelessly defeated, that he composed
the &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo; It was during
tedious years of imprisonment that Bunyan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span>
wrote his immortal allegory. Many a genius
has owed his best opportunities to poverty,
because poverty had happily excluded him
from society, and so preserved him from
time-devouring exigencies and frivolities.</p>

<p>The solitude which is really injurious is the
severance from all who are capable of understanding
us. Painters say that they cannot
work effectively for very long together when
separated from the society of artists, and
that they must return to London, or Paris,
or Rome, to avoid an oppressive feeling of
discouragement which paralyzes their productive
energy. Authors are more fortunate,
because all cultivated people are society
for them; yet even authors lose strength
and agility of thought when too long deprived
of a genial intellectual atmosphere.
In the country you meet with cultivated individuals;
but we need more than this, we
need those general conversations in which
every speaker is worth listening to. The life
most favorable to culture would have its
times of open and equal intercourse with the
best minds, and also its periods of retreat.
My ideal would be a house in London, not far
from one or two houses that are so full of
light and warmth that it is a liberal education
to have entered them, and a solitary
tower on some island of the Hebrides, with
no companions but the sea-gulls and the
thundering surges of the Atlantic. One such
island I know well, and it is before my mind&rsquo;s
eye, clear as a picture, whilst I am writing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>413</span>
It stands in the very entrance of a fine salt-water
loch, rising above two hundred feet
out of the water and setting its granite front
steep against the western ocean. When the
evenings are clear you can see Staffa and
Iona like blue clouds between you and the
sunset; and on your left, close at hand, the
granite hills of Mull, with Ulva to the right
across the narrow strait. It was the dream
of my youth to build a tower there, with
three or four little rooms in it, and walls as
strong as a lighthouse. There have been
more foolish dreams, and there have been
less competent teachers than the tempests
that would have roused me and the calms
that would have brought me peace. If any
serious thought, if any noble inspiration
might have been hoped for, surely it would
have been there, where only the clouds and
waves were transient, but the ocean before
me, and the stars above, and the mountains
on either hand, were emblems and evidences
of eternity.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;There is a passage in Scott&rsquo;s novel, &ldquo;The Pirate,&rdquo;
which illustrates what has been said in this letter about the
necessity for concealing superior culture in the presence of
less intellectual companions, and I quote it the more willingly
that Scott was so remarkably free from any morbid aversion
to society, and so capable of taking a sincere interest in
every human being.</p>

<p>Cleveland is speaking to Minna:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought over my former story, and saw that seeming
more brave, skilful, and enterprising than others had gained
me command and respect, and that seeming more gently
nurtured and more civilized than they had made them envy
and hate me as a being of another species. <i>I bargained with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
myself then, that since I could not lay aside my superiority
of intellect and education, I would do my best to disguise
and to sink, in the rude seaman, all appearance of better
feeling and better accomplishments.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A similar policy is often quite as necessary in the society of
landsmen.</p></div>

<h3><i>INTELLECTUAL HYGIENICS.</i></h3>
<hr class="full" />


<h3 class="pt3">LETTER I.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG AUTHOR WHILST HE WAS WRITING
HIS FIRST BOOK.</h5>

<p class="pro">Mr. Galton&rsquo;s advice to young travellers&mdash;That we ought to
interest ourselves in the <i>progress</i> of a journey&mdash;The
same rule applicable in intellectual things&mdash;Women in the
cabin of a canal boat&mdash;Working hastily for temporary
purposes&mdash;Fevered eagerness to get work done&mdash;Beginners
have rarely acquired firm intellectual habits&mdash;Knowing
the range of our own powers&mdash;The coolness of accomplished
artists&mdash;Advice given by Ingres&mdash;Balzac&rsquo;s method
of work&mdash;Scott, Horace Vernet, John Phillip&mdash;Decided
workers are deliberate workers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I read</span> the other day, in Galton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Art of
Travel,&rdquo; a little bit which concerns you and
all of us, but I made the extract in my commonplace-book
for your benefit rather than
my own, because the truth it contains has
been &ldquo;borne in upon me&rdquo; by my own experience,
so that what Mr. Galton says did not
give me a new conviction, but only confirmed
me in an old one. He is speaking to explorers
who have not done so much in that way
as he has himself, and though the subject of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>
advice is the conduct of an exploring party
(in the wilds of Australia, for example) the
advice itself is equally useful if taken metaphorically,
and applied to the conduct of intellectual
labors and explorations of all kinds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interest yourself,&rdquo; says Mr. Galton,
&ldquo;chiefly in the progress of your journey, and
do not look forward to its end with eagerness.
It is better to think of a return to civilization,
not as an end to hardship and a haven from
ill, but as a thing to be regretted, and as a
close to an adventurous and pleasant life.
In this way, risking less, you will insensibly
creep on, making connections, and learning
the capabilities of the country as you advance,
which will be found invaluable in the
case of a hurried or a disastrous return. And
thus, when some months have passed by, you
will look back with surprise on the great distance
travelled over; for if you average only
three miles a day, at the end of the year you
will have advanced 1000, which is a very
considerable exploration. The fable of the
hare and the tortoise seems expressly intended
for travellers over wide and unknown
tracts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, we ought to interest ourselves chiefly
in the progress of our work, and not to look
forward to its end with eagerness. That
eagerness of which Mr. Galton speaks has
spoiled many a piece of work besides a geographical
exploration, and it not only spoils
work, but it does worse, it spoils life also.
How am I to enjoy this year as I ought, if I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
am continually wishing it were over? A truly
intellectual philosophy must begin by recognizing
the fact that the intellectual paths are
infinitely long, that there will always be new
horizons behind the horizon that is before us,
and that we must accept a gradual advance as
the law of our intellectual life. It is our business
to move forwards, but we ought to do so
without any greater feeling of hurry than that
which affects the most stationary of minds.
Not a bad example for us is a bargeman&rsquo;s
wife in a canal-boat. She moves; movement
is the law of her life; yet <span class="correction" title="amended from see">she</span> is as tranquil in
her little cabin as any goodwife on shore,
brewing her tea and preparing her buttered
toast without ever thinking about getting to
the end of her journey. For if that voyage
were ended, another would always succeed to
it, and another! In striking contrast to the
unhurried bargeman&rsquo;s wife in her cabin is an
irritable Frenchman in the corner of a diligence,
looking at his watch every half-hour,
and wishing that the dust and rattle were
over, and he were in his own easy-chair at
home. Those who really lead the intellectual
life, and have embraced it for better and for
worse, are like the bargeman&rsquo;s wife; but
those who live the life from time to time only,
for some special purpose, wishing to be rid of
it as soon as that purpose is accomplished,
are like the sufferer in the purgatory of the
diligence. Is there indeed really any true intellectual
life at all when every hour of labor
is spoiled by a feverish eagerness to be at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span>
end of the projected task? You cannot take
a bit out of another man&rsquo;s life and live it,
without having lived the previous years that
led up to it, without having also the assured
hopes for the years that lie beyond. The attempt
is constantly made by amateurs of all
kinds, and by men of temporary purposes,
and it always fails. The amateur says when
he awakes on some fine summer morning,
and draws up his blind, and looks out on the
dewy fields: &ldquo;Ah, the world of nature is
beautiful to-day: what if I were to lead the
life of an artist?&rdquo; And after breakfast he
seeks up his old box of watercolor and his
blockbook, and stool, and white umbrella,
and what not, and sallies forth, and fixes himself
on the edge of the forest or the banks of
the amber stream. The day that he passes
there looks like an artist&rsquo;s day, yet it is not.
It has not been preceded by the three or four
thousand days which ought to have led up to
it; it is not strong in the assured sense of
present skill, in the calm knowledge that the
hours will bear good fruit. So the chances
are that there will be some hurry, and fretfulness,
and impatience, under the shadow of
that white parasol, and also that when the
day is over there will be a disappointment.
You cannot put an artist&rsquo;s day into the life of
any one but an artist.</p>

<p>Our impatiences come mainly, I think,
from an amateurish doubt about our own
capacity, which is accompanied by a fevered
eagerness to see the work done, because we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>
are tormented both by hopes and fears so
long as it is in progress. We have fears that
it may not turn out as it ought to do, and we
have at the same time hopes for its success.
Both these causes produce eagerness, and
deprive us of the tranquillity which distinguishes
the thorough workman, and which is
necessary to thoroughness in the work itself.
Now please observe that I am not advising
you to set aside these hopes and fears by an
effort of the will; when you have them they
are the inevitable result of your state of culture,
and the will can no more get rid of them
than it can get rid of an organic disease.
When you have a limited amount of power
and of culture, and are not quite clear in your
own mind as to where the limits lie, it is
natural on the one hand that you should fear
the insufficiency of what you possess, and on
the other that in more sanguine moments
you should indulge in hopes which are
only extravagant because your powers have
not yet been accurately measured. You will
alternate between fear and hope, according
to the temporary predominance of saddening
or cheerful ideas, but both these feelings
will urge you to complete the work in
hand, that you may see your own powers
reflected in it, and measure them more exactly.
This is the main cause of the eagerness
of young authors, and the reason why
they often launch work upon the sea of publicity
which is sure to go immediately to the
bottom, from the unworkmanlike haste with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
which it has been put together. But beyond
this there is another cause, which is, that
beginners in literature have rarely acquired
firm intellectual habits, that they do not yet
lead the tranquil intellectual life, so that such
a piece of work as the composition of a book
keeps them in an unwholesome state of excitement.
When you feel this coming upon
you, pray remember Mr. Galton&rsquo;s wise traveller
in unknown tracts, or the bargeman&rsquo;s
wife in the canal-boat.</p>

<p>Amongst the many advantages of experience,
one of the most valuable is that we
come to know the range of our own powers,
and if we are wise we keep contentedly within
them. This relieves us from the malady
of eagerness; we know pretty accurately beforehand
what our work will be when it is
done, and therefore we are not in a hurry to
see it accomplished. The coolness of old
hands in all departments of labor is due in
part to the cooling of the temperament by
age, but it is due even more to the fulness of
acquired experience, for we do not find
middle-aged men so cool in situations where
they feel themselves incompetent. The conduct
of the most experienced painters in the
management of their work is a good example
of this masterly coolness, because we can see
them painting in their studios whereas we
cannot so easily see or so justly estimate the
coolness of scientific or literary workmen. A
painter of great experience will have, usually,
several pictures at a time upon his easels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>
and pass an hour upon one, or an hour upon
the other, simple as the state of the pigment
invites him without ever being tempted to
risk anything by hurrying a process. The
ugly preparatory daubing which irritates the
impatience of the beginner does not disturb
<i>his</i> equanimity; he has laid it with a
view to the long-foreseen result, and it satisfies
him temporarily as the right thing for
the time being. If you know what is the
right thing for the time being, and always do
it, you are sure of the calm of the thorough
workman. All his touches, except the very
last touch on each work, are touches of preparation,
leading gradually up to his result.
Ingres used to counsel his pupils to sketch
always, to sketch upon and within the first
sketch till the picture came right in the end;
and this was strictly Balzac&rsquo;s method in literature.
The literary and artistic labors of
these two men did not proceed so much
upon the principle of travelling as upon that
of cultivation. They took an idea in the
rough, as a settler takes a tract from wild nature,
and then they went over it repeatedly,
each time pushing the cultivation of it a little
farther. Scott, Horace Vernet, John Phillip,
and many others, have worked rather on the
principle of travelling, passing over the
ground once, and leaving it, never coming
back again to correct the mistakes of yesterday.
Both methods of work require deliberation,
but the latter needs it in the supreme
degree. All very decided workers, men who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
did not correct, have been at the same time
very deliberate workers&mdash;rapid, in the sense
of accomplishing much in the course of the
year, or the life, but cautious and slow and
observant whilst they actually labored, thinking
out very carefully every sentence before
they wrote it, every touch of paint before
they laid it.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<h5>TO A STUDENT IN THE FIRST ARDOR OF INTELLECTUAL
AMBITION.</h5>

<p class="pro">The first freshness&mdash;Why should it not be preserved?&mdash;The
dulness of the intellectual&mdash;Fictions and false promises&mdash;Ennui
in work itself&mdash;Dürer&rsquo;s engraving of Melancholy&mdash;Scott
about Dryden&mdash;Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth&mdash;Humboldt,
Cuvier, Goethe&mdash;Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Maud&rdquo;&mdash;Preventives
of <i>ennui</i>&mdash;Hard study for limited times&mdash;The <i>ennui</i> of
jaded faculties.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> been thinking about you frequently
of late, and the burden or refrain of my
thoughts has been &ldquo;What a blessing he has
in that first freshness, if only he could keep
it!&rdquo; But now I am beginning more hopefully
to ask myself, &ldquo;Why should he not keep
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be an experiment worth trying,
so to order your intellectual life, that however
stony and thorny your path might be,
however difficult and arduous, it should at
all events never be dull; or, to express what
I mean more accurately, that you yourself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>
should never feel the depressing influences of
dulness during the years when they are most
to be dreaded. I want you to live steadily
and happily in your intellectual labors, even
to the natural close of existence, and my best
wish for you is that you may escape a long
and miserable malady which brain-workers
very commonly suffer from when the first
dreams of youth have been disappointed&mdash;a
malady in which the intellectual desires are
feeble, the intellectual hopes are few; whose
victim, if he has still resolution enough to
learn anything, acquires without satisfaction,
and, if he has courage to create, has neither
pride nor pleasure in his creations.</p>

<p>If I were to sing the praises of knowledge
as they have been so often sung by louder
harps than mine, I might avoid so dreary a
theme. It is easy to pretend to believe that
the intellectual life is always sure to be interesting
and delightful, but the truth is that,
either from an unwise arrangement of their
work, or from mental or physical causes
which we will investigate to some extent before
we have done with the subject, many
men whose occupations are reputed to be
amongst the most interesting have suffered
terribly from <i>ennui</i>, and that not during a
week or two at a time, but for consecutive
years and years.</p>

<p>There is a class of books written with the
praiseworthy intention of stimulating young
men to intellectual labor, in which this danger
of the intellectual life is systematically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>424</span>
ignored. It is assumed in these books that
the satisfactions of intellectual labor are certain;
that although it may not always, or
often, result in outward and material prosperity,
its inward joys will never fail. Promises
of this kind cannot safely be made to any
one. The satisfactions of intellectual riches
are not more sure than the satisfactions of
material riches; the feeling of dull indifference
which often so mysteriously clouds the
life of the rich man in the midst of the most
elaborate contrivances for his pleasure and
amusement, has its exact counterpart in the
lives of men who are rich in the best treasures
of the mind, and who have infinite intellectual
resources. However brilliant your
ability, however brave and persistent your
industry, however vast your knowledge,
there is always this dreadful possibility of <i>ennui</i>.
People tell you that work is a specific
against it, but many a man has worked
steadily and earnestly, and suffered terribly
from <i>ennui</i> all the time that he was working,
although the labor was of his own choice, the
labor that he loved best, and for which Nature
evidently intended him. The poets, from
Solomon downwards, have all of them, so far
as I know, given utterance in one page or another
of their writings to this feeling of
dreary dissatisfaction, and Albert Dürer, in
his &ldquo;Melencolia,&rdquo; illustrated it. It is plain
that the robust female figure which has exercised
the ingenuity of so many commentators
is not melancholy either from weakness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>425</span>
the body or vacancy of the mind. She is
strong and she is learned; yet, though the
plumes of her wings are mighty, she sits
heavily and listlessly, brooding amidst the
implements of suspended labor, on the shore
of a waveless sea. The truth is that Dürer
engraved the melancholy that he himself only
too intimately knew. This is not the dulness
of the ignorant and incapable, whose minds
are a blank because they have no ideas, whose
hands are listless for want of an occupation;
it is the sadness of the most learned, the most
intelligent, the most industrious; the weary
misery of those who are rich in the attainments
of culture, who have the keys of the
chambers of knowledge, and wings to bear
them to the heaven of the ideal. If you counsel
this &ldquo;Melencolia&rdquo; to work that she may
be merry, she will answer that she knows
the uses of labor and its vanity, and the precise
amount of profit that a man hath of all
his labor which he taketh under the sun. All
things are full of labor, she will tell you; and
in much wisdom is much grief, and he that
increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>

<p>Can we escape this brooding melancholy of
the great workers&mdash;has any truly intellectual
person escaped it ever? The question can
never be answered with perfect certainty, because
we can never quite accurately know
the whole truth about the life of another. I
have known several men of action, almost
entirely devoid of intellectual culture, who
enjoyed an unbroken flow of animal energy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
and were clearly free from the melancholy of
Dürer; but I never intimately knew a really
cultivated person who had not suffered from
it more or less, and the greatest sufferers
were the most conscientious thinkers and
students. Amongst the illustrious dead, it
may be very safely answered that any poet
who has described it has written from his
own experience&mdash;a transient experience it
may be, yet his own. When Walter Scott,
<i>à-propos</i> of Dryden, spoke of &ldquo;the apparently
causeless fluctuation of spirits incident
to one doomed to labor incessantly in the
feverish exercise of the imagination,&rdquo; and of
that &ldquo;sinking of spirit which follows violent
mental exertion,&rdquo; is it not evident that his
kindly understanding of Dryden&rsquo;s case came
from the sympathy of a fellow-laborer who
knew by his own experience the gloomier and
more depressing passages of the imaginative
life? It would be prudent perhaps to omit
the mention of Byron, because some may attribute
his sadness to his immorality; and if I
spoke of Shelley, they might answer that he
was &ldquo;sad because he was impious;&rdquo; but the
truth is, that quite independently of conduct,
and even of belief, it was scarcely possible
for natures so highly imaginative as these
two, and so ethereally intellectual as one of
the two, to escape those clouds of gloom
which darken the intellectual life. Wordsworth
was not immoral, Wordsworth was
not unorthodox, yet he could be as sad in his
own sober way as Byron in the bitterness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>
his desolation, or Shelley in his tenderest
wailing. The three men who seem to have
been the least subject to the sadness of intellectual
workers were Alexander Humboldt,
Cuvier, and Goethe. Alexander Humboldt,
so far as is known to us, lived always in a
clear and cheerful daylight; his appetite for
learning was both strong and regular; he embraced
the intellectual life in his earliest manhood,
and lived in it with an unhesitating
singleness of purpose, to the limits of extreme
old age. Cuvier was to the last a model student,
of a temper at once most unflinching
and most kind, happy in all his studies, happier
still in his unequalled facility of mental
self-direction. Goethe, as all know, lived a
life of unflagging interest in each of the three
great branches of intellectual labor. During
the whole of his long life he was interested in
literature, in which he was a master; he was
interested in science, in which he was a discoverer,
and in art, of which he was an ardent
though not practically successful student.
His intellectual activity ceased only
on rare occasions of painful illness or overwhelming
affliction; he does not seem to
have asked himself ever whether knowledge
was worth its cost; he was always ready to
pay the appointed price of toil. He had no
infirmity of intellectual doubt; the powerful
impulses from within assured him that knowledge
was good for him, and he went to it
urged by an unerring instinct, as a young
salmon bred in the slime of a river seeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
strength in the infinite sea. And yet, being
a poet and a man of strong passions, Goethe
did not altogether escape the green-sickness
which afflicts the imaginative temperament,
or he could never have written &ldquo;Werther;&rdquo;
but he cured himself very soon, and the author
of &ldquo;Werther&rdquo; had no indulgence for
Wertherism&mdash;indeed we are told that he
grew ashamed of having written the book
which inoculated the younger minds of Europe
with that miserable disease. In our
own time an illustrious poet has given in
&ldquo;Maud&rdquo; a very perfect study of a young
mind in a morbid condition, a mind having
indeed the student-temper, but of a bad kind,
that which comes not from the genuine love
of study, but from sulky rage against the
world.</p>

<p>This kind of self-burial in one&rsquo;s library does
not come from the love of literature. The
recluse will not speak to his neighbor, yet
needs human intercourse of some kind, and
seeks it in reading, urged by an inward
necessity. He feels no gratitude towards the
winners of knowledge; his morbid ill-nature
depreciates the intellectual laborers:&mdash;</p>

<p>What is the life such a spirit will choose

men need, the harmony of a life well tuned?</p>

<p>There are many different morbid states of
the mind, and this of the hero of &ldquo;Maud&rdquo; is
only one of them, but it is the commonest
amongst intellectual or semi-intellectual
young men. See how he has a little fit of
momentary enthusiasm (all he is capable of)
about a shell that suddenly and accidentally
attracts his attention. How true to the morbid
nature is that incident! Unable to pursue
any large and systematic observation, the
diseased mind is attracted to things suddenly
and accidentally, sees them out of all proportion,
and then falls into the inevitable fit of
scornful peevishness.</p>

<p>The question which concerns the world is,
how this condition of the mind may be
avoided. The cure Mr. Tennyson suggested
was war; but wars, though more frequent
than is desirable, are not to be had always.
And in your case, my friend, it is happily
not a cure but a preventive that is needed.
Let me recommend certain precautions which
taken together are likely to keep you safe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>
Care for the physical health in the first place,
for if there is a morbid mind the bodily organs
are not doing their work as they ought to do.
Next, for the mind itself, I would heartily
recommend hard study, really hard study,
taken very regularly but in very moderate
quantity. The effect of it on the mind is as
bracing as that of cold water on the body,
but as you ought not to remain too long in
the cold bath, so it is dangerous to study <i>hard</i>
more than a short time every day. Do some
work that is very difficult (such as reading
some language that you have to puzzle out <i>à
coups de dictionnaire</i>) two hours a day regularly,
to brace the fighting power of the intellect,
but let the rest of the day&rsquo;s work be
easier. Acquire especially, if you possibly
can, the enviable faculty of getting entirely
rid of your work in the intervals of it, and of
taking a hearty interest in common things,
in a garden, or stable, or dog-kennel, or
farm. If the work pursues you&mdash;if what is
called unconscious cerebration, which ought
to go forward without your knowing it, becomes
conscious cerebration, and bothers
you, then you have been working beyond
your cerebral strength, and you are not safe.</p>

<p>An organization which was intended by
Nature for the intellectual life cannot be
healthy and happy without a certain degree
of intellectual activity. Natures like those of
Humboldt and Goethe need immense labors
for their own felicity, smaller powers need less
extensive labor. To all of us who have intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span>
needs there is a certain supply of work
necessary to perfect health. If we do less, we
are in danger of that ennui which comes from
want of intellectual exercise; if we do more,
we may suffer from that other ennui which is
due to the weariness of the jaded faculties,
and this is the more terrible of the two.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO AN INTELLECTUAL MAN WHO DESIRED AN
OUTLET FOR HIS ENERGIES.</h5>

<p class="pro">Dissatisfaction of the intellectual when they have not an extensive
influence&mdash;A consideration suggested to the author
by Mr. Matthew Arnold&mdash;Each individual mind a portion
of the national mind, which must rise or decline with the
minds of which it is composed&mdash;Influence of a townsman
in his town&mdash;Household influence&mdash;Charities and condescendences
of the highly cultivated&mdash;A suggestion of M.
Taine&mdash;Conversation with inferiors&mdash;How to make it interesting&mdash;That
we ought to be satisfied with humble results
and small successes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">There</span> is a very marked tendency amongst
persons of culture to feel dissatisfied with
themselves and their success in life when they
do not exercise some direct and visible influence
over a considerable portion of the public.
To put the case in a more concrete form,
it may be affirmed that if an intellectual
young man does not exercise influence by literature,
or by oratory, or by one of the most
elevated forms of art, he is apt to think that
his culture and intelligence are lost upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span>
world, and either to blame himself for being
what he considers a failure, or else (and this
is more common) to find fault with the world
in general for not giving him a proper chance
of making his abilities tell. The facilities for
obtaining culture are now so many and great,
and within the reach of so many well-to-do
people, that hundreds of persons become really
very clever in various ways who would have
remained utterly uncultivated had they lived
in any previous century. A few of these distinguish
themselves in literature and other
pursuits which bring notoriety to the successful,
but by far the greater number have to remain
in positions of obscurity, often being
clearly conscious that they have abilities and
knowledge not much, if at all, inferior to the
abilities and knowledge of some who have
achieved distinction. The position of a clever
man who remains obscure is, if he has ambition,
rather trying to the moral fibre, but
there are certain considerations which might
help to give a direction to his energy and so
procure him a sure relief, which reputation
too frequently fails to provide.</p>

<p>The first consideration is one which was offered
to me many years ago by Mr. Matthew
Arnold, and which I can give, though from
memory, very nearly in his own words. The
multiplicity of things which make claim to
the attention of the public is in these days
such that it requires either uncommon
strength of will or else the force of peculiar
circumstances to make men follow any serious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>
study to good result, and the great majority
content themselves with the general
enlightenment of the epoch, which they get
from newspapers and reviews. Hence the efforts
of the intellectual produce little effect,
and it requires either extraordinary talent or
extraordinary fanaticism to awaken the serious
interest of any considerable number of
readers. Yet, in spite of these discouragements,
we ought to remember that our labors,
if not applauded by others, may be of infinite
value to ourselves, and also that beyond this
gain to the individual, his culture is a gain to
the nation, whether the nation formally recognizes
it or not. For the intellectual life of
a nation is the sum of the lives of all intellectual
people belonging to it, and in this sense
your culture is a gain to England, whether
England counts you amongst her eminent
sons, or leaves you forever obscure. Is it
not a noble spectacle, a spectacle well worthy
of a highly civilized country, when a private
citizen, with an admirable combination of
patriotism and self-respect, says to himself as
he labors, &ldquo;I know that in a country so great
as England, where there are so many able
men, all that I do can count for very little in
public estimation, yet I will endeavor to store
my mind with knowledge and make my judgment
sure, in order that the national mind of
England, of which my mind is a minute fraction,
may be enlightened by so much, be it
never so little&rdquo;? I think the same noble feeling
might animate a citizen with reference to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>434</span>
his native town; I think a good townsman
might say to himself, &ldquo;Our folks are not
much given to the cultivation of their minds,
and they need a few to set them an example.
I will be one of those few. I will work and
think, in order that our town may not get
into a state of perfect intellectual stagnation.&rdquo;
But if the nation or the city were too vast to
call forth any noble feeling of this kind, surely
the family is little enough and near enough.
Might not a man say, &ldquo;I will go through a
good deal of intellectual drudgery in order
that my wife and children may unconsciously
get the benefit of it; I will learn facts for them
that they may be accurate, and get ideas for
them that they may share with me a more
elevated mental state; I will do something
towards raising the tone of the whole household&rdquo;?</p>

<p>The practical difficulty in all projects of
this kind is that the household does not care
to be intellectually elevated, and opposes the
resistance of gravitation. The household has
its natural intellectual level, and finds it as
inevitably as water that is free. Cultivated
men are surrounded in their homes by a group
of persons, wife, children, servants, who, in
their intercourse with one another, create the
household tone. What is a single individual
with his books against these combined and
active influences? Is he to go and preach the
gospel of the intellect in the kitchen? Will
he venture to present intellectual conclusions
in the drawing-room? The kitchen has a tone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>435</span>
of its own which all our efforts cannot elevate,
and the drawing-room has its own atmosphere,
an atmosphere unfavorable to severe
and manly thinking. You cannot make cooks
intellectual, and you must not be didactic
with ladies. Intellectual men always feel
this difficulty, and most commonly keep their
intellect very much to themselves, when they
are at home. If they have not an outlet elsewhere,
either in society or in literature, they
grow morbid.</p>

<p>Yet, although it is useless to attempt to elevate
any human being above his own intellectual
level unless he gradually climbs himself
as a man ascends a mountain, there are
nevertheless certain charities or condescendences
of the highly cultivated which may be
good for the lower intelligences that surround
them, as the streams from the Alpine snows
are good for the irrigation of the valleys,
though the meadows which they water must
forever remain eight or ten thousand feet
below them. And I believe that it would
greatly add to the happiness of the intellectual
portion of mankind if they could more
systematically exercise these charities. It is
quite clear that we can never effect by chance
conversation that total change in the mental
state which is gradually brought about by the
slow processes of education; we cannot give
to an intellect that has never been developed,
and which has fixed itself in the undeveloped
state, that power and activity which come
only after years of labor; but we may be able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span>
on many occasions to offer the sort of help
which a gentleman offers to an old woman
when he invites her to get up into the rumble
behind his carriage. I knew an intellectual
lady who lived habitually in the country, and
I may say without fanciful exaggeration that
the farmers&rsquo; wives round about her were considerably
superior to what in all probability
they would have been without the advantage
of her kindly and instructive conversation.
She possessed the happy art of conveying the
sort of knowledge which could be readily received
by her hearers, and in a manner which
made it agreeable to them, so that they drew
ideas from her quite naturally, and her mind
irrigated their minds, which would have remained
permanently barren without that help
and refreshment. It would be foolish to exaggerate
the benefits of such intellectual charity
as this, but it is well, on the other hand,
not to undervalue it. Such an influence can
never convey much solid instruction, but it
may convey some of its results. It may
produce a more thoughtful and reasonable
condition of mind, it may preserve the ignorant
from some of those preposterous theories
and beliefs which so easily gain currency
amongst them. Indirectly, it may have
rather an important political influence, by
disposing people to vote for the better sort of
candidate. And the influence of such intellectual
charity on the material well being of
the humbler classes, on their health and
wealth, may be quite as considerable as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>437</span>
of the other and more common sort of charity
which passes silver from hand to hand.</p>

<p>Shortly after the termination of the great
Franco-German conflict, M. Taine suggested
in the <i>Temps</i> that subscribers to the better
sort of journals might do a good deal for the
enlightenment of the humbler classes by
merely lending their newspapers in their
neighborhood. This was a good suggestion:
the best newspapers are an important intellectual
propaganda; they awaken an interest
in the most various subjects, and supply not
only information but a stimulus. The danger
to persons of higher culture that the newspaper
may absorb time which would else be
devoted to more systematic study, does not
exist in the classes for whose benefit M. Taine
made his recommendation. The newspaper
is their only secular reading, and without it
they have no modern literature of any kind.
In addition to the praiseworthy habit of lending
good newspapers, an intellectual man who
lives in the country might adopt the practice
of conversing with his neighbors about everything
in which they could be induced to take
an interest, giving them some notion of what
goes on in the classes which are intellectually
active, some idea of such discoveries and projects
as an untutored mind may partially understand.
For example, there is the great
tunnel under the Mont Cenis, and there is the
projected tunnel beneath the Channel, and
there is the cutting of the Isthmus of Suez.
A peasant can comprehend the greatness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>438</span>
these remarkable conceptions when they are
properly explained to him, and he will often
feel a lively gratitude for information of that
kind. We ought to remember what a slow
and painful operation reading is to the uneducated.
Merely to read the native tongue is
to them a labor so irksome that they are apt
to lose the sense of a paragraph in seeking for
that of a sentence or an expression. As they
would rather speak than have to write, so
they prefer hearing to reading, and they get
much more good from it, because they can
ask a question when the matter has not been
made clear to them.</p>

<p>One of the best ways of interesting and instructing
your intellectual inferiors is to give
them an account of your travels. All people
like to hear a traveller tell his own tale,
and whilst he is telling it he may slip in a
good deal of information about many things,
and much sound doctrine. Accounts of foreign
countries, even when you have not seen
them personally, nearly always awaken a
lively interest, especially if you are able to
give your hearers detailed descriptions of the
life led by foreigners who occupy positions
corresponding to their own. Peasants can
be made to take an interest in astronomy
even, though you cannot tell them anything
about the peasants in Jupiter and Mars, and
there is always, at starting, the great difficulty
of persuading them to trust science
about the motion and rotundity of the earth.</p>

<p>A very direct form of intellectual charity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>439</span>
is that of gratuitous teaching, both in classes
and by public lectures, open to all comers.
A great deal of light has in this way been
spread abroad in cities, but in country villages
there is little encouragement to enterprises
of this kind, the intelligence of farm
laborers being less awakened than that of the
corresponding urban population. Let us remember,
however, that one of the very highest
and last achievements of the cultivated
intellect is the art of conveying to the uncultivated,
the untaught, the unprepared, the
best and noblest knowledge which they are
capable of assimilating. No one who, like the
writer of these pages, has lived much in the
country, and much amongst a densely ignorant
peasantry, will be likely in any plans of
enlightenment to err far on the side of enthusiastic
hopefulness. The mind of a farm laborer,
or that of a small farmer, is almost always
sure to be a remarkably stiff soil, in
which few intellectual conceptions can take
root; yet these few may make the difference
between an existence worthy of a man, and
one that differs from the existence of a brute
in little beyond the possession of articulate
language. We to whom the rich inheritance
of intellectual humanity is so familiar as to
have lost much of its freshness, are liable to
underrate the value of thoughts and discoveries
which to us have for years seemed commonplace.
It is with our intellectual as with
our material wealth; we do not realize how
precious some fragments of it might be to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>440</span>
poorer neighbors. The old clothes that we
wear no longer may give comfort and confidence
to a man in naked destitution; the
truths which are so familiar to us that we
never think about them, may raise the utterly
ignorant to a sense of their human brotherhood.</p>

<p>Above all, in the exercise of our intellectual
charities, let us accustom ourselves to feel
satisfied with humble results and small successes;
and here let me make a confession
which may be of some possible use to others.
When a young man, I taught a drawing-class
gratuitously, beginning with thirty-six pupils,
who dwindled gradually to eleven. Soon
afterwards I gave up the work from dissatisfaction,
on account of the meagre attendance.
This was very wrong&mdash;the eleven were worth
the thirty-six; and so long as one of the eleven
remained I ought to have contentedly taught
him. The success of a teacher is not to be
measured by the numbers whom he immediately
influences. It is enough, it has been
proved to be enough in more than one remarkable
instance, that a single living soul should
be in unison with the soul of a master, and
receive his thought by sympathy. The one
disciple teaches in his turn, and the idea is
propagated.</p>

<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>TO THE FRIEND OF A MAN OF HIGH CULTURE
WHO PRODUCED NOTHING.</h5>

<p class="pro">Joubert&mdash;&ldquo;Not yet time,&rdquo; or else &ldquo;The time is past&rdquo;&mdash;His
weakness for production&mdash;Three classes of minds&mdash;A
more perfect intellectual life attainable by the silent student
than by authors&mdash;He may follow his own genius&mdash;Saving
of time effected by abstinence from writing&mdash;The
unproductive may be more influential than the prolific.</p>

<p><span class="sc">When</span> I met B. at your house last week,
you whispered to me in the drawing-room that
he was a man of the most remarkable attainments,
who, to the great regret of all his
friends, had never employed his abilities to
any visible purpose. We had not time for a
conversation on this subject, because B. himself
immediately joined us. His talk reminded
me very much of Joubert&mdash;not that I ever
knew Joubert personally, though I have lived
very near to Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, where
Joubert lived; but he is one of those characters
whom it is possible to know without having
seen them in the flesh. His friends used
to urge him to write something, and then he
said, &ldquo;<i>Pas encore.</i>&rdquo;  &ldquo;Not yet; I need a long
peace.&rdquo; Tranquillity came, and then he said
that God had only given force to his mind for
a limited time, and that the time was past.
Therefore, as Sainte-Beuve observed, for Joubert
there was no medium; either it was not
yet time, or else the time was past.</p>

<p>Nothing is more common than for <i>other</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>442</span>
people to say this of us. They often say &ldquo;He
is too young,&rdquo; as Napoleon said of Ingres, or
else &ldquo;He is too old,&rdquo; as Napoleon said of
Greuze. It is more rare for a man himself to
shrink from every enterprise, first under the
persuasion that he is unprepared, and afterwards
because the time is no longer opportune.
Yet there does exist a certain very peculiar
class of highly-gifted, diffident, delicate, unproductive
minds, which impress those around
them with an almost superstitious belief in
their possibilities, yet never do anything to
justify that belief.</p>

<p>But may it not be doubted whether these
minds <i>have</i> productive power of any kind? I
believe that the full extent of Joubert&rsquo;s productive
power is displayed in those sentences
of his which have been preserved, and which
reveal a genius of the rarest delicacy, but at
the same time singularly incapable of sustained
intellectual effort. He said that he
could only compose slowly, and with an extreme
fatigue. He believed, however, that
the weakness lay in the instrument alone, in
the composing faculties, and not in the faculties
of thought, for he said that behind his
weakness there was strength, as behind the
strength of some others there was weakness.</p>

<p>In saying this, it is probable that Joubert
did not overestimate himself. He <i>had</i>
strength of a certain kind, or rather he had
quality; he had distinction, which is a sort of
strength in society and in literature. But he
had no productive force, and I do not believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>443</span>
that his unproductiveness was a productiveness
checked by a fastidious taste; I believe
that it was real, that he was not organized for
production.</p>

<p>Sainte-Beuve said that a modern philosopher
was accustomed to distinguish three
classes of minds&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Those who are at once powerful and delicate,
who excel as they propose, execute
what they conceive, and reach the great and
true beautiful&mdash;a rare <i>élite</i> amongst mortals.</p>

<p>2. A class of minds especially characterized
by their delicacy, who feel that their idea is
superior to their execution, their intelligence
greater than their talent, even when the talent
is very real; they are easily dissatisfied
with themselves, disdain easily won praises,
and would rather judge, taste, and abstain
from producing, than remain below their conception
and themselves. Or if they write it
is by fragments, for themselves only, at long
intervals and at rare moments. Their fecundity
is internal, and known to few.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, there is a third class of minds
more powerful and less delicate or difficult to
please, who go on producing and publishing
themselves without being too much dissatisfied
with their work.</p>

<p>The majority of our active painters and
writers, who fill modern exhibitions, and produce
the current literature of the day, belong
to the last class, to which we are all greatly
indebted for the daily bread of literature and
art.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>444</span> </p>

<p>But Sainte-Beuve believed that Joubert belonged
to the second class, and I suspect that
both Sainte-Beuve and many others have
credited that class with a potential productiveness
beyond its real endowments. Minds
of the Joubert class are admirable and valuable
in their way, but they are really, and not
apparently, sterile.</p>

<p>And why would we have it otherwise?
When we lament that a man of culture has
&ldquo;done nothing,&rdquo; as we say, we mean that he
has not written books. Is it necessary, is it
desirable, that every cultivated person should
write books?</p>

<p>On the contrary, it seems that a more perfect
intellectual life may be attained by the
silent student than by authors. The writer
for the public is often so far its slave that he
is compelled by necessity or induced by the
desire for success (since it is humiliating to
write unsaleable books as well as unprofitable)
to deviate from his true path, to leave
the subjects that most interest him for other
subjects which interest him less, and therefore
to acquire knowledge rather as a matter
of business than as a labor of love. But the
student who never publishes, and does not intend
to publish, may follow his own genius
and take the knowledge which belongs to him
by natural affinity. Add to this the immense
saving of time effected by abstinence from
writing. Whilst the writer is polishing his
periods, and giving hours to the artistic exigencies
of mere form, the reader is adding to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>445</span>
his knowledge. Thackeray said that writers
were not great readers, because they had not
the time.</p>

<p>The most studious Frenchman I ever met
with used to say that he so hated the pen as
scarcely to resolve to write a letter. He reminded
me of Joubert in this; he often said,
&ldquo;J&rsquo;ai horreur de la plume.&rdquo; Since he had no
profession his leisure was unlimited, and he
employed it in educating himself without any
other purpose than this, the highest purpose
of all, to become a cultivated man. The very
prevalent idea that lives of this kind are failures
unless they leave some visible achievement
as a testimony and justification of their
labors, is based upon a narrow conception both
of duty and of utility. Men of this unproductive
class are sure to influence their immediate
neighborhood by the example of their life.
Isolated as they are too frequently in the provinces,
in the midst of populations destitute
of the higher culture, they often establish the
notion of it notwithstanding the contemptuous
estimates of the practical people around them.
A single intellectual life, thus modestly lived
through in the obscurity of a country-town,
may leave a tradition and become an enduring
influence. In this, as in all things, let us trust
the arrangements of Nature. If men are at
the same time constitutionally studious and
constitutionally unproductive, in must be that
production is not the only use of study. Joubert
was right in keeping silence when he felt
no impulses to speak, right also in saying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>446</span>
little that he did say without a superfluous
word. His mind is more fully known, and
more influential, than many which are abundantly
productive.</p>

<h3>LETTER V.</h3>

<h5>TO A STUDENT WHO FELT HURRIED AND DRIVEN.</h5>

<p class="pro">Some intellectual products possible only in excitement&mdash;Byron&rsquo;s
authority on the subject&mdash;Can inventive minds work
regularly?&mdash;Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s opinion&mdash;Napoleon on the
winning of victories&mdash;The prosaic business of men of genius&mdash;&ldquo;Waiting
for inspiration&rdquo;&mdash;Rembrandt&rsquo;s advice to a
young painter&mdash;Culture necessary to inspiration itself&mdash;Byron,
Keats, Morris&mdash;Men of genius may be regular as
students.</p>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> my last letter to you on quiet regularity
of work, I did not give much consideration to
another matter which, in certain kinds of
work, has to be taken into account, for I preferred
to make that the subject of a separate
letter. There are certain intellectual products
which are only possible in hours or minutes of
great cerebral excitement. Byron said that
when people were surprised to find poets very
much like others in the ordinary intercourse
of life, their surprise was due to ignorance of
this. If people knew, Byron said, that poetical
production came from an excitement
which from its intensity could only be temporary,
they would not expect poets to be very
different from other people when not under
the influence of this excitement. Now, we
may take the word &ldquo;poet,&rdquo; in this connection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>447</span>
in the very largest sense. All men who have
the gift of invention are poets. The inventive
ideas come to them at unforeseen moments,
and have to be seized when they come,
so that the true inventor works sometimes
with vertiginous rapidity, and afterwards remains
for days or weeks without exercising
the inventive faculty at all. The question is,
can you make an inventive mind work on the
principle of measured and regular advance.
Is such counsel as that in my former letter
applicable to inventors?</p>

<p>Scott said, that although he had known
many men of ordinary abilities who were capable
of perfect regularity in their habits, he
had never known a man of genius who was
so. The popular impression concerning men
of genius is very strong in the same sense,
but it is well not to attach too much importance
to popular impressions concerning men
of genius, for the obvious reason that such
men come very little under popular observation.
When they work it is usually in the
most perfect solitude, and even people who
live in the same house know very little, really,
of their intellectual habits.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be, first, that the moments
of high excitement, of noblest invention,
are rare, and not to be commanded by the
will; but, on the other hand, that in order to
make the gift of invention produce its full effect
in any department of human effort, vast
labors of preparation are necessary, and these
labors may be pursued as steadily as you like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>448</span>
Napoleon I. used to say that battles were won
by the sudden flashing of an idea through the
brain of the commander at a certain critical
instant. The capacity for generating this
sudden electric spark was military genius.
The spark flashed independently of the will;
the General could not win that vivid illumination
by labor or by prayer; it came only in
the brain of genius from the intense anxiety
and excitement of the actual conflict. Napoleon
seems always to have counted upon it,
always to have believed that when the critical
instant arrived the wild confusion of the
battle-field would be illuminated for him by
that burst of sudden flame. But if Napoleon
had been ignorant of the prosaic business of
his profession, to which he attended more
closely than any other commander, what
would these moments of supreme clearness
have availed him, or would they ever have
come to him at all? If they had come to him,
they would have revealed only the extent of
his own negligence. Instead of showing him
<i>what to do</i>, they would have made painfully
evident what <i>ought to have been done</i>. But it
is more probable that these clear moments
would never have occurred to a mind unprepared
by study. Clear military inspirations
never occur to shopkeepers and farmers, as
bright ideas about checkmates occur only to
persons who have studied chess. The prosaic
business, then, of the man of genius is to accumulate
that preparatory knowledge without
which his genius can never be available,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>449</span>
and he can do work of this kind as regularly
as he likes.</p>

<p>The one fatal mistake which is committed
habitually by people who have the scarcely
desirable gift of half-genius is &ldquo;waiting for
inspiration.&rdquo; They pass week after week in
a state of indolence, unprofitable alike to the
mind and the purse, under pretext of waiting
for intellectual flashes like those which came
to Napoleon on his battle-fields. They ought
to remember the advice given by one of the
greatest artists of the seventeenth century to
a young painter of his acquaintance. &ldquo;Practise
assiduously what you already know, and
in course of time other things will become
clear to you.&rdquo; The inspirations come only to
the disciplined; the indolent wait for them in
vain.</p>

<p>If you have genius, therefore, or believe
you have, it is admitted that you cannot be
perpetually in a state of intense excitement.
If you were in that state without ceasing, you
would go mad. You cannot be expected to
write poetry in the plodding ox-pace manner
advocated for intellectual work generally in
my last letter. As for that good old comparison
between the hare and the tortoise, it may
be answered for you, simply, that you are not
a tortoise, and that what is a most wise procedure
for tortoises may be impracticable for
you. The actual composition of poetry, especially
poetry of a fiery kind, like&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1 f90">&ldquo;The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece,&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>450</span></p>

<p class="noind">of Byron, is to be done not when the poet
will, but when he can, or rather, when he
<i>must</i>.</p>

<p>But if you are a wise genius you will feel
how necessary is culture even for work of
that kind. Byron would not have felt any
enthusiasm for the isles of Greece if he had
not known something of their history. The
verses are an inspiration, but they could
never have occurred to a quite uncultivated
person, however bright his inspirations. Even
more obviously was the genius of Keats dependent
upon his culture. He did not read
Greek, but from translations of Greek literature
and from the direct study of Greek art
he got the sort of material that he needed.
And in our own day Morris has been evidently
a very diligent student of many literatures.
What I insist upon is, that we could
not have had the real Keats, the real Morris,
unless they had prepared themselves by culture.
We see immediately that the work they
have done is <i>their</i> work, specially, that they
were specially adapted for it&mdash;inspired for it,
if you will. But how evident it is that the
inspiration could never have produced the
work, or anything like it, without labor in
the accumulation of material!</p>

<p>Now, although men of genius cannot be
regularly progressive in actual production,
cannot write so many verses a day, regularly,
as you may spin yarn, they can be very regular
as students, and some of the best of them
have been quite remarkable for unflinching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>
steadiness of application in that way. The
great principle recommended by Mr. Galton,
of not looking forward eagerly to the end of
your journey, but interesting yourself chiefly
in the progress of it, is as applicable to the
studies of men of genius as to those of more
ordinary persons.</p>

<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>

<h5>TO AN ARDENT FRIEND WHO TOOK NO REST.</h5>

<p class="pro">On some verses of Goethe&mdash;Man not constituted like a planet&mdash;Matthew
Arnold&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;Self-dependence&rdquo;&mdash;Poetry
and prose&mdash;The wind more imitable than the stars&mdash;The
stone in Glen Croe&mdash;Rest and be thankful.</p>

<p><span class="sc">&ldquo;Rambling</span> over the wild moors, with
thoughts oftentimes as wild and dreary as
those moors, the young Carlyle, who had
been cheered through his struggling sadness,
and strengthened for the part he was to play
in life, by the beauty and the wisdom which
Goethe had revealed to him, suddenly conceived
the idea that it would be a pleasant
and a fitting thing if some of the few admirers
in England forwarded to Weimar a trifling
token of their admiration. On reaching home
Mr. Carlyle at once sketched the design of a
seal to be engraved, the serpent of eternity
encircling a star, with the words <i>ohne Hast,
ohne Rast</i> (unhasting, unresting), in allusion
to the well-known verses&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>452</span> </p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&lsquo;Wie das Gestirn,</p>
<p class="i05">Ohne Hast</p>
<p class="i05">Aber ohne Rast</p>
<p class="i05">Drehe sich jeder</p>
<p class="i05">Um die eigne Last.&rsquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">(Like a star, unhasting, unresting, be each
one fulfilling his God-given &lsquo;hest.&rsquo;)&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_10" id="FnAnchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>This is said so beautifully, and seems so
wise, that it may easily settle down into the
mind as a maxim and rule of life. Had we
been told in plain prose to take no rest, without
the beautiful simile of the star, and without
the wise restriction about haste, our common
sense would have rebelled at once; but
as both beauty and wisdom exist together in
the gem-like stanza, our judgment remains
silent in charmed acquiescence.</p>

<p>Let us ask ourselves, however, about this
stella example, whether man is naturally so
constituted as to be able to imitate it. A
planet moves without haste, because it is incapable
of excitement; and without rest, because
it is incapable of fatigue. A planet makes
no effort, and encounters no friction or resistance
of any kind. Man is so constituted as to
feel frequently the stimulus of excitement,
which immediately translates itself either into
actual acceleration or into the desire for acceleration&mdash;a
desire which cannot be restrained
without an effort; and whatever man undertakes
to do he encounters friction and resistance,
which, for him, always sooner or later
inevitably induce fatigue. Man is neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>
constituted like a star nor situated like a star,
and therefore it is not possible for him to exist
as stars exist.</p>

<p>You will object to this criticism that it
handles a delicate little poem very roughly,
and you may tell me that I am unfit to receive
the wisdom of the poets, which is always
uttered with a touch of Oriental exaggeration.
Certainly Goethe could never
mean that a man should kill himself by labors
literally incessant. Goethe&rsquo;s own life is the
best elucidation of his true meaning. The
example of the star was held up to us to be
followed only within the limits of our human
nature, as a Christian points to the example
of Christ. In the same spirit Matthew Arnold
wrote his noble poem &ldquo;Self-dependence,&rdquo;
in which he tells us to live like the stars and
the sea:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Ah, once more,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;ye stars, ye waters,</p>
  <p class="i1">On my heart your mighty charm renew;</p>
<p>Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you,</p>
  <p class="i1">Feel my soul becoming vast like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven,</p>
  <p class="i1">Over the lit sea&rsquo;s unquiet way,</p>
<p>In the rustling night-air came the answer:</p>
  <p class="i1">&ldquo;Wouldst thou <i>be</i> as these are? <i>Live</i> as they.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Unaffrighted by the silence round them,</p>
  <p class="i1">Undistracted by the sights they see,</p>
<p>These demand not that the things without them</p>
  <p class="i1">Yield them love, amusement, sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The true intention of poetical teachings like
these is in the influence they have over the
feelings. If a star makes me steadier in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>454</span>
labor, less of a victim to vain agitation, in
consequence of Goethe&rsquo;s verses; if the stars
and the sea together renew more fully their
mighty charm upon my heart because those
stanzas of Arnold have fixed themselves in
my memory, the poets have done their work.
But the more positive <i>prosateur</i> has his work
to do also, and you, as it seems to me, need
this positive help of prose.</p>

<p>You are living a great deal too much like a
star, and not enough like a human being.
You do not hasten often, but you <i>never</i> rest,
except when Nature mercifully prostrates
you in irresistible sleep. Like the stars and
the sea in Arnold&rsquo;s poem, you do not ask surrounding
things to yield you love, amusement,
sympathy. The stars and the sea can
do without these refreshments of the brain
and heart, but you cannot. Rest is necessary
to recruit your intellectual forces; sympathy
is necessary to prevent your whole nature
from stiffening like a rotifer without moisture;
love is necessary to make life beautiful
for you, as the plumage of certain birds becomes
splendid when they pair; and without
amusement you will lose the gayety which
wise men try to keep as the best legacy of
youth.</p>

<p>Let your rest be perfect in its season, like
the rest of waters that are still. If you will
have a model for your living, take neither
the stars, for they fly without ceasing, nor
the ocean that ebbs and flows, nor the river
that cannot stay, but rather let your life be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>455</span>
like that of the summer air, which has times
of noble energy and times of perfect peace.
It fills the sails of ships upon the sea, and the
miller thanks it on the breezy uplands; it
works generously for the health and wealth
of all men, yet it claims its hours of rest. &ldquo;I
have pushed the fleet, I have turned the mill,
I have refreshed the city, and now, though
the captain may walk impatiently on the
quarter-deck, and the miller swear, and the
city stink, I will stir no more until it pleases
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You have learned many things, my friend,
but one thing you have <i>not</i> learned&mdash;the art
of resting. That stone in Glen Croe ought to
have impressed its lesson on the mind of
many a traveller, long before Earl Russell
gave it a newspaper celebrity. Have we not
rested there together, you and I, a little in
advance of the coach, which the weary horses
were still slowly dragging up the tedious hill?
And as we sat on the turf, and looked down
the misty glen, did we not read the lesson
there engraven? How good and <i>human</i> the
idea was, the idea of setting up that graven
stone in the wilderness; how full of sympathy
is that inscription for all the weakness and
weariness of humanity! Once, in the ardor
of youth, there shone before me a golden star
in heaven, and on the deep azure around it
&ldquo;<i>Ohne Hast, ohne Rast</i>,&rdquo; in letters of steady
flame; but now I see more frequently a plain
little stone set up in the earth, with the inscription,
&ldquo;Rest, and be thankful!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>456</span> </p>

<p>Is not the stone just a little like a grave-stone,
my friend? Perhaps it is. But if we
take rest when we require it during life, we
shall not need the grave&rsquo;s rest quite so soon.</p>

grain of desert-sand&mdash;The freedom of the wild bee.</p>

<p><span class="sc">If</span> we asked any intellectual workman
what he would do if his life were to be lived
over again, I believe the answer, whatever
its form, would amount ultimately to this:
&ldquo;I would economize my time better.&rdquo; Very
likely if the opportunity were granted him
he would do nothing of the sort; very likely
he would waste his time in ways more authorized
by custom, yet waste it just as extravagantly
as he had done after his own
original fashion; but it always seems to us as
if we could use the time better if we had it
over again.</p>

<p>It seems to me in looking back over the last
thirty years, that the only time really wasted
has been that spent in laborious obedience
to some external authority. It may be a
dangerous doctrine which Claude Tillier expressed
in an immortal sentence, but dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>457</span>
or not, it is full of intellectual truth: &ldquo;Le
temps le mieux employé est celui que l&rsquo;on
perd.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_11" id="FnAnchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> If what we are accustomed to consider
lost time could be removed, as to its
effects at least, from the sum of our existence,
it is certain that we should suffer from a
great intellectual impoverishment. All the
best knowledge of mankind, to begin with, is
acquired in hours which hard-working people
consider lost hours&mdash;in hours, that is, of
pleasure and recreation. Deduct all that we
have learnt about men in times of recreation,
in clubs and smoking-rooms, on the hunting-field,
on the cricket-ground, on the deck of
the yacht, on the box of the drag or the dog-cart,
would the residue be worth very much?
would it not be a mere heap of dry bones
without any warm flesh to cover them?
Even the education of most of us, such as it
is, has been in a great measure acquired out
of school, as it were; I mean outside of the
acknowledged duties of our more serious existence.
Few Englishmen past forty have
studied English literature either as a college
exercise or a professional preparation; they
have read it privately, as an amusement.
Few Englishmen past forty have studied
modern languages, or science, or the fine arts,
from any obedience to duty, but merely from
taste and inclination. And even if we studied
these things formally, as young men
often do at the present day, it is not from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>
formal study that we should get the <i>perfume</i>
of the language or the art, but from idle
hours in foreign lands and galleries. It is superfluous
to recommend idleness to the unintellectual,
but the intellectual too often undervalue
it. The laborious intellect contracts
a habit of strenuousness which is some
times a hindrance to its best activity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have arrived,&rdquo; said Sainte-Beuve, &ldquo;perhaps
by way of secretly excusing my own
idleness, perhaps by a deeper feeling of the
principle that all comes to the same, at the
conclusion that whatever I do or do not,
working in the study at continuous labor,
scattering myself in articles, spreading myself
about in society, giving my time away to
troublesome callers, to poor people, to <i>rendez-vous</i>,
in the street, no matter to whom and to
what, I cease not to do one and the same
thing, to read one and the same book, the infinite
book of the world and of life, that no
one ever finishes, in which the wisest read
farthest; I read it then at all the pages which
present themselves, in broken fragments,
backwards, what matters it? I never cease
going on. The greater the medley, the more
frequent the interruption, the more I get on
with this book in which one is never beyond
the middle; but the profit is to have had it
open before one at all sorts of different
pages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A distinguished author wrote to another
author less distinguished: &ldquo;You have gone
through a good deal of really vigorous study,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>459</span>
but have not <i>been in harness</i> yet.&rdquo; By harness
he meant discipline settled beforehand like military
drill. Now, the advantages of drill are
evident and very generally recognized, but
the advantages of intellectual <i>flânerie</i> are not
so generally recognized. For the work of
the intellect to be clear and healthy, a great
deal of free play of the mind is absolutely
necessary. Harness is good for an hour or
two at a time, but the finest intellects have
never <i>lived</i> in harness. In reading any book
that has much vitality you are sure to meet
with many allusions and illustrations which
the author hit upon, not when he was in harness,
but out at grass. Harness trains us to
the systematic performance of our work, and
increases our practical strength by regulated
exercise, but it does not supply everything
that is necessary to the perfect development
of the mind. The truth is, that we need both
the discipline of harness and the abundant
nourishment of the free pasture. Yet may
not our freedom be the profitless, choiceless,
freedom of a grain of desert-sand, carried
hither and thither by the wind, gaining nothing
and improving nothing, so that it does
not signify where it was carried yesterday or
where it may fall to-morrow, but rather the
liberty of the wild bee, whose coming and going
are ordered by no master, nor fixed by
any premeditated regulation, yet which misses
no opportunity of increase, and comes home
laden in the twilight. Who knows where he
has wandered; who can tell over what banks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
and streams the hum of his wings has sounded?
Is anything in nature freer than he is; can
anything account better for a rational use of
freedom? Would he do his work better if
tiny harness were ingeniously contrived for
him? Where then would be the golden honey,
and where the waxen cells?</p>

<h3>LETTER VIII.</h3>

<h5>TO A FRIEND (HIGHLY CULTIVATED) WHO CONGRATULATED
HIMSELF ON HAVING ENTIRELY
ABANDONED THE HABIT OF READING NEWSPAPERS.</h5>

<p class="pro">Advantages in economy of time&mdash;Much of what we read in
newspapers is useless to our culture&mdash;The too great importance
which they attach to novelty&mdash;Distortion by
party spirit&mdash;An instance of false presentation&mdash;Gains
to serenity by abstinence from newspapers&mdash;Newspapers
keep up our daily interest in each other&mdash;The
French peasantry&mdash;The newspaper-reading Americans&mdash;An
instance of total abstinence from newspapers&mdash;Auguste
Comte&mdash;A suggestion of Emerson&rsquo;s&mdash;The work of
newspaper correspondents&mdash;War correspondents&mdash;Mr.
Stanley&mdash;M. Erdan, of the <i>Temps</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Your</span> abstinence from newspaper reading is
not anew experiment in itself, though it is
new in reference to your particular case, and
I await its effects with interest. I shall be
curious to observe the consequences, to an intellect
constituted as yours is, of that total
cutting off from the public interests of your
own century which an abstinence from newspapers
implies. It is clear that, whatever the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>461</span>
loss may be, you have a definite gain to set
against it. The time which you have hitherto
given to newspapers, and which may be
roughly estimated at about five hundred
hours a year, is henceforth a valuable time-income
to be applied to whatever purposes
your best wisdom may select. When an intellectual
person has contrived by the force of
one simple resolution to effect so fine an
economy as this, it is natural that he should
congratulate himself. Your feelings must be
like those of an able finance minister who has
found means of closing a great leak in the
treasury&mdash;if any economy possible in the
finances of a State could ever relatively equal
that splendid stroke of time-thrift which your
force of will has enabled you to effect. In
those five hundred hours, which are now
your own, you may acquire a science or obtain
a more perfect command over one of the
languages which you have studied. Some department
of your intellectual labors which
has hitherto been unsatisfactory to you, because
it was too imperfectly cultivated, may
henceforth be as orderly and as fruitful as a
well-kept garden. You may become thoroughly
conversant with the works of more than
one great author whom you have neglected,
not from lack of interest, but from want of
time. You may open some old chamber of
the memory that has been dark and disused
for many a year; you may clear the cobwebs
away, and let the fresh light in, and make it
habitable once again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span> </p>

<p>Against these gains, of which some to a man
of your industry are certain, and may be
counted upon, what must be our estimate of
the amount of sacrifice or loss? It is clear to
both of us that much of what we read in the
newspapers is useless to our culture. A large
proportion of newspaper-writing is occupied
with speculation on what is likely to happen
in the course of a few months; therefore, by
waiting until the time is past, we know the
event without having wasted time in speculations
which could not effect it. Another rather
considerable fraction of newspaper matter
consists of small events which have interest
for the day, owing to their novelty, but which
will not have the slightest permanent importance.
The whole press of a newspaper-reading
country, like England or America, may
be actively engaged during the space of a
week or a fortnight in discussing some incident
which everybody will have forgotten in
six months; and besides these sensational incidents,
there are hundreds of less notorious
ones, often fictitious, inserted simply for the
temporary amusement of the reader. The
greatest evil of newspapers, in their effect on
the intellectual life, is the enormous importance
which they are obliged to attach to
mere novelty. From the intellectual point of
view, it is of no consequence whether a
thought occurred twenty-two centuries ago to
Aristotle or yesterday evening to Mr. Charles
Darwin, and it is one of the distinctive marks
of the truly intellectual to be able to take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>463</span>
hearty interest in all truth, independently of
the date of its discovery. The emphasis given
by newspapers to novelty exhibits things in
wrong relations, as the lantern shows you what
is nearest at the cost of making the general
landscape appear darker by the contrast. Besides
this exhibition of things in wrong relations,
there is a positive distortion arising from
the unscrupulousness of party, a distortion
which extends far beyond the limits of the
empire.</p>

<p>An essay might be written on the distortion
of English affairs in the French
press, or of French affairs in the English
press, by writers who are as strongly partisan
in another country as in their own. &ldquo;It is
such a grand thing,&rdquo; wrote an English Paris
correspondent in 1870, &ldquo;for Adolphus Thiers,
son of a poor laborer of Aix, and in early life
a simple journalist, to be at the head of the
Government of France.&rdquo; This is a fair specimen
of the kind of false presentation which is
so common in party journalism. The newspaper
from which I have quoted it was strongly
opposed to Thiers, being in fact one of the
principal organs of the English Bonapartists.
It is not true that Thiers was the son of a
poor laborer of Aix. His father was a workman
of Marseilles, his mother belonging to a
family in which neither wealth nor culture
had been rare, and his mother&rsquo;s relatives had
him educated at the Lycée. The art of the
journalist in bringing together the two extremes
of a career remarkable for its steady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>464</span>
ascent had for its object to produce the idea of
incongruity, of sudden and unsuitable elevation.
Not only M. Thiers, however, but every
human being starts from a very small beginning,
since every man begins life as a baby.
It is a great rise for one baby to the Presidency
of the French Republic; it was also a
great rise for other babies who have attained
the premiership of England. The question is,
not what Thiers may have been seventy years
ago, but what he was immediately before his
acceptance of the highest office of the State.
He was the most trusted and the most experienced
citizen, so that the last step in his
career was as natural as the elevation of
Reynolds to the presidency of the Academy.</p>

<p>It is difficult for any one who cares for justice
to read party journals without frequent
irritation, and it does not signify which side
the newspaper takes. Men are so unfair in
controversy that we best preserve the serenity
of the intellect by studiously avoiding all
literature that has a controversial tone. By
your new rule of abstinence from newspapers
you will no doubt gain almost as much in
serenity as in time. To the ordinary newspaper
reader there is little loss of serenity, because
he reads only the newspaper that he
agrees with, and however unfair it is, he is
pleased by its unfairness. But the highest
and best culture makes us disapprove of unfairness
on our own side of the question also.
We are pained by it; we feel humiliated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>465</span>
it; we lament its persistence and its perversity.</p>

<p>I have said nearly all that has to be said in
favor of your rule of abstinence. I have
granted that the newspapers cost us much
time, which, if employed for great intellectual
purposes, would carry us very far; that
they give disproportionate views of things by
the emphasis they give to novelty, and false
views by the unfairness which belongs to
party. I might have added that newspaper
writers give such a preponderance to politics&mdash;not
political philosophy, but to the everyday
work of politicians&mdash;that intellectual culture
is thrown into the background, and the
election of a single member of Parliament is
made to seem of greater national importance
than the birth of a powerful idea. And yet,
notwithstanding all these considerations,
which are serious indeed for the intellectual,
I believe that your resolution is unwise, and
that you will find it to be untenable. One
momentous reason more than counterbalances
all these considerations put together. Newspapers
are to the whole civilized world what
the daily house-talk is to the members of a
household; they keep up our daily interest in
each other, they save us from the evils of isolation.
To live as a member of the great
white race of men, the race that has filled
Europe and America, and colonized or conquered
whatever other territories it has been
pleased to occupy, to share from day to day
its cares, its thoughts, its aspirations, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>
necessary that every man should read his
daily newspaper. Why are the French peasants
so bewildered and at sea, so out of place in
the modern world? It is because they never
read a newspaper. And why are the inhabitants
of the United States, though scattered
over a territory fourteen times the area of
France, so much more capable of concerted
political action, so much more <i>alive</i> and modern,
so much more interested in new discoveries
of all kinds and capable of selecting and
utilizing the best of them? It is because the
newspaper penetrates everywhere; and even
the lonely dweller on the prairie or in the
forest is not intellectually isolated from the
great currents of public life which flow
through the telegraph and the press.</p>

<p>The experiment of doing without newspapers
has been tried by a whole class, the
French peasantry, with the consequences that
we know, and it has also from time to time
been tried by single individuals belonging to
more enlightened sections of society. Let us
take one instance, and let us note what appear
to have been the effects of this abstinence.
Auguste Comte abstained from newspapers
as a teetotaller abstains from spirituous liquors.
Now, Auguste Comte possessed a gift
of nature which, though common in minor
degrees, is in the degree in which he possessed
it rarer than enormous diamonds. That gift
was the power of dealing with abstract intellectual
conceptions, and living amidst them
always, as the practical mind lives in and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>467</span>
deals with material things. And it happened
in Comte&rsquo;s case, as it usually does happen in
cases of very peculiar endowment, that the
gift was accompanied by the instincts necessary
to its perfect development and to its preservation.
Comte instinctively avoided the
conversation of ordinary people, because he
felt it to be injurious to the perfect exercise of
his faculty, and for the same reason he would
not read newspapers. In imposing upon himself
these privations he acted like a very eminent
living etcher, who, having the gift of an
extraordinary delicacy of hand, preserves it
by abstinence from everything that may effect
the steadiness of the nerves. There is a certain
difference, however, between the two
cases which I am anxious to accentuate. The
etcher runs no risk of any kind by his rule of
abstinence. He refrains from several common
indulgences, but he denies himself nothing
that is necessary to health. I may even go
farther, and say that the rules which he observes
for the sake of perfection in his art,
might be observed with advantage by many
who are not artists, for the sake of their own
tranquillity, without the loss of anything but
pleasure. The rules which Comte made for
himself involved, on the other hand, a great
peril. In detaching himself so completely
from the interests and ways of thinking of
ordinary men, he elaborated, indeed, the conceptions
of the positive philosophy, but arrived
afterwards at a peculiar kind of intellectual
decadence from which it is possible&mdash;probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>468</span>
even&mdash;that the rough common sense of the
newspapers might have preserved him. They
would have saved him, I seriously believe,
from that mysticism which led to the invention
of a religion far surpassing in unreasonableness
the least rational of the creeds of tradition.
It is scarcely imaginable, except on
the supposition of actual insanity, that any
regular reader of the <i>Times</i>, the <i>Temps</i>, the
<i>Daily News</i>, and the <i>Saturday Review</i>, should
believe the human race to be capable of receiving
as the religion of its maturity the Comtist
Trinity and the Comtist Virgin Mother. A
Trinity consisting of the Great Being (or humanity),
the Great Fetish (or the earth), and
the Great Midst (or space); a hope for the human
race (how unphysiological!) that women
might ultimately arrive at maternity independently
of virile help,&mdash;these are conceptions
so remote, not only from the habits of
modern thought, but (what is more important)
from its tendencies, that they could not
occur to a mind in regular communication
with its contemporaries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you should transfer the amount of your
reading day by day from the newspaper to
the standard authors?&rdquo; To this suggestion of
Emerson&rsquo;s it may be answered that the loss
would be greater than the gain. The writers
of Queen Anne&rsquo;s time could educate an Englishman
of Queen Anne&rsquo;s time, but they can
only partially educate an Englishman of Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s time. The mind is like a merchant&rsquo;s
ledger, it requires to be continually posted up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>469</span>
to the latest date. Even the last telegram
may have upset some venerable theory that
has been received as infallible for ages.</p>

<p>In times when great historical events are
passing before our eyes, the journalist is to
future historians what the African traveller
is to the map-makers. His work is neither
complete nor orderly, but it is the fresh record
of an eye-witness, and enables us to become
ourselves spectators of the mighty drama of
the world. Never was this service so well
rendered as it is now, by correspondents who
achieve heroic feats of bodily and mental
prowess, exposing themselves to the greatest
dangers, and writing much and well in circumstances
the most unfavorable to literary
composition. How vividly the English war
correspondents brought before us the reality
of the great conflict between Germany and
France! What a romantic achievement,
worthy to be sung in heroic verse, was the
finding of Livingstone by Stanley! Not less
interesting have been the admirable series of
letters by M. Erdan in the <i>Temps</i>, in which,
with the firmness of a master-hand, he has
painted from the life, week after week, year
after year, the decline and fall of the temporal
power of the Papacy. I cannot think that
any page of Roman history is better worth
reading than his letters, more interesting, instructive,
lively, or authentic. Yet with your
contempt for newspapers you would lose all
this profitable entertainment, and seek instead
of it the accounts of former epochs not half so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>470</span>
interesting as this fall of the temporal power,
accounts written in most cases by men in libraries
who had not seen the sovereigns they
wrote about, nor talked with the people whose
condition they attempted to describe. You
have a respect for these accounts because they
are printed in books, and bound in leather,
and entitled &ldquo;history,&rdquo; whilst you despise the
direct observation of a man like Erdan, because
he is only a journalist, and his letters
are published in a newspaper. Is there not
some touch of prejudice in this, some mistake,
some narrowness of intellectual aristocracy?</p>

<h3>LETTER IX.</h3>

<h5>TO AN AUTHOR WHO APPRECIATED CONTEMPORARY
LITERATURE.</h5>

<p class="pro">Miss Mitford on the selfishness of authors&mdash;A suggestion of
Emerson&rsquo;s&mdash;A laconic rule of his&mdash;Traces of jealousy&mdash;And
of a more subtle feeling&mdash;A contradiction&mdash;Necessary
to resist the invasion of the present&mdash;A certain equilibrium&mdash;The
opposite of a pedant&mdash;The best classics not
pedants, but artists.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Reading</span> the other day a letter by Miss Mitford,
I was reminded of you as the eye is reminded
of green when it sees scarlet. You,
whose interest in literature has ever kept pace
with the time, to whom no new thing is unwelcome
if only it is good, are safe from her
accusations; but how many authors have deserved
them! Miss Mitford is speaking of a
certain writer who is at the same time a clergyman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id="page471"></a>471</span>
and whom it is not difficult to recognize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;saw him interested
in the slightest degree by the work of any
other author, except, indeed, one of his own
followers or of his own clique, and then only
as admiring or helping him. He has great
kindness and great sympathy with working
people, or with a dying friend, but I profess to
you I am amazed at the utter selfishness of authors.
I do not know one single poet who cares
for any man&rsquo;s poetry but his own. In general
they read no books except such as may be necessary
to their own writings&mdash;that is to the
work they happen to be about, and even then I
suspect that they only read the bits that they
may immediately want. You know the absolute
ignorance in which Wordsworth lived of
all modern works; and if, out of compliment to
a visitor, he thought it needful to seem to read
or listen to two or three stanzas, he gave unhesitating
praise to the writer himself, but took
especial care not to repeat the praise where it
might have done him good&mdash;utterly fair and
false.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are touches of this spirit of indifference
to contemporary literature in several
writers and scholars whom we know. There
are distinct traces of it even in published
writings, though it is much more evident in
private life and habit. Emerson seriously
suggests that &ldquo;the human mind would perhaps
be a gainer if all the secondary writers
were lost&mdash;say, in England, all but Shakespeare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>472</span>
Milton, and Bacon, through the profounder
study so drawn to those wonderful
minds.&rdquo; In the same spirit we have Emerson&rsquo;s
laconic rule, &ldquo;Never read any but famed
books,&rdquo; which suggests the remark that if
men had obeyed this rule from the beginning,
no book could ever have acquired reputation,
and nobody would ever have read anything.
The idea of limiting English literature to a
holy trinity of Shakespeare, Milton, and
Bacon, and voluntarily losing all other authors,
seems to me the most intense expression
of the spirit of aristocracy in reading.
It is as if a man were to decide in his own
mind that society would be the better if all
persons except the three Emperors were excluded
from it. There is a want of reliance
upon one&rsquo;s own judgment, and an excess of
faith in the estimates of others, when we resolve
to read only those books which come to
us in the splendor of a recognized intellectual
royalty. We read either to gain information,
to have good thinking suggested to us, or to
have our imagination stimulated. In the way
of knowledge the best authors are always the
most recent, so that Bacon could not suffice.
In the way of thinking, our methods have
gained in precision since Milton&rsquo;s time, and
we are helped by a larger experience than his.
The one thing which Shakespeare and Milton
can do for us quite perfectly still, is to fill our
imagination richly, and give it a fine stimulus.
But modern writers can render us the
same service.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>473</span></p>

<p>Is there not a little jealousy of contemporaries
in the persistence with which some
authors avoid them, and even engage others
to avoid them? May not there be a shade of
another feeling than jealousy, a feeling more
subtle in operation, the undefined apprehension
that we may find, even amongst our
more obscure contemporaries, merit equal to
our own? So long as we restrict our reading
to old books of great fame we are safe from
this apprehension, for if we find admirable
qualities, we know beforehand that the world
has handsomely acknowledged them, and we
indulge in the hope that our own admirable
qualities will be recognized by posterity with
equal liberality. But it creates an unpleasant
feeling of uneasiness to see quantities of obscure
contemporary work, done in a plain
way to earn a living by men of third or fourth-rate
reputation, or of no reputation at all,
which in many respects would fairly sustain
a comparison with our own. It is clear that
an author ought to be the last person to
advise the public not to read contemporary
literature, since he is himself a maker of contemporary
literature; and there is a direct
contradiction between the invitation to read
his book, which he circulates by the act of
publishing, and the advice which the book
contains. Emerson is more safe from this
obvious rejoinder when he suggests to us to
transfer our reading day by day from the
newspaper to the standard authors. But are
these suggestions anything more than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>474</span>
reaction of an intellectual man against the
too prevalent customs of the world? The
reading practised by most people, by all who
do not set before themselves intellectual culture
as one of the definite aims of life, is remarkable
for the regularity with which it
neglects all the great authors of the past.
The books provided by the circulating library,
the reviews and magazines, the daily newspapers,
are read whilst they are novelties,
but the standard authors are left on their
shelves unopened. We require a firm resolution
to resist this invasion of what is new,
because it flows like an unceasing river, and
unless we protect our time against it by some
solid embankment of unshakable rule and
resolution, every nook and cranny of it will
be filled and flooded. An Englishman whose
life was devoted to culture, but who lived in
an out-of-the-way place on the Continent, told
me that he considered it a decided advantage
to his mind to live quite outside of the English
library system, because if he wanted to read
a new book he had to buy it and pay heavily
for carriage besides, which made him very
careful in his choice. For the same reason
he rejoiced that the nearest English news-room
was two hundred miles from his residence.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, what would be the
condition of a man&rsquo;s mind who never read
anything but the classic authors? He would
live in an intellectual monastery, and would
not even understand the classic authors themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>475</span>
for we understand the past only by
referring it to what we know in the present.</p>

<p>It is best to preserve our minds in a state of
equilibrium, and not to allow our repugnance
to what we see as an evil to drive us into an
evil of an opposite kind. We are too often
like those little toy-fish with a bit of steel in
their mouths, which children attract with a
magnet. If you present the positive pole of
the magnet, the fish rushes at it at once, but
if you offer the negative end it retreats continually.
Everything relatively to our character
has this positive or negative end, and we
either rush to things or rush away from them.
Some persons are actually driven away
from the most entertaining writers because
they happen to be what are called classics, because
pedants boast of having read them. I
know a man who is exactly the opposite of a
pedant, who has a horror of the charlatanism
which claims social and intellectual position
as the reward for having laboriously waded
through those authors who are conventionally
termed &ldquo;classical,&rdquo; and this opposition to
pedantry has given him an aversion to the
classics themselves, which he never opens.
The shallow pretence to admiration of famous
writers which is current in the world is so distasteful
to the love of honesty and reality
which is the basis of his character, that by
an unhappy association of ideas he has acquired
a repugnance to the writers themselves.
But such men as Horace, Terence,
Shakespeare, Molière, though they have had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476"></a>476</span>
the misfortune to be praised and commentated
upon by pedants, were in their lives the
precise opposite of pedants; they were <i>artists</i>
whose study was human nature, and who
lived without pretension in the common
world of men. The pedants have a habit of
considering these genial old artists as in some
mysterious way their own private property,
for do not the pedants live by expounding
them? And some of us are frightened away
from the fairest realms of poetry by the
fences of these grim guardians.</p>

<h5>TO AN AUTHOR WHO KEPT VERY IRREGULAR
HOURS.</h5>

should be done in the best hours&mdash;Physicians prefer early
to late work&mdash;The practice of Goethe and some modern
authors&mdash;The morning worker ought to live in a tranquil

faculty&mdash;The Duke of Wellington&mdash;The faculty more available

minute obedience to the clock&mdash;Broad rules the best&mdash;Books
of agenda, good in business, but not in the higher
intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p><span class="sc">What</span> you told me of your habits in the
employment of your hours reminded me of
Julian Fane. Mr. Lytton tells us that &ldquo;after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>477</span>
a long day of professional business, followed
by a late evening of social amusement, he
would return in the small hours of the night
to his books, and sit, unwearied, till sunrise
in the study of them. Nor did he then seem
to suffer from this habit of late hours. His
nightly vigils occasioned no appearance of
fatigue the next day.... He rarely rose before
noon, and generally rose much later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But however irregular a man&rsquo;s distribution
of his time may be in the sense of wanting
the government of fixed rules, there always
comes in time a certain regularity by the
mere operation of habit. People who get up
very late hardly ever do so in obedience to a
rule; many get up early by rule, and many
more are told that they ought to get up early,
and believe it, and aspire to that virtue, but
fail to carry it into practice. The late-risers
are rebels and sinners&mdash;in this respect&mdash;to a
man, and so persistently have the wise, from
Solomon downwards, harped upon the moral
loveliness of early rising and the degradation
which follows the opposite practice, that
one can hardly get up after eight without
either an uncomfortable sense of guilt or an extraordinary
callousness. Yet the late-risers,
though obeying no rule, for the abandoned
sinner recognizes none, become regular in
their late rising from the gradual fixing power
of habit. Even Julian Fane, though he
regretted his desultory ways, &ldquo;and dwelt
with great earnestness on the importance
of regular habits of work,&rdquo; was perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>478</span>
less irregular than he himself believed. We
are sure to acquire habits; what is important
is not so much that the habits should
be regular, as that their regularity should
be of the kind most favorable in the long run
to the accomplishment of our designs, and
this never comes by chance, it is the result of
an effort of the will in obedience to governing
wisdom.</p>

<p>The first question which every one who has
the choice of his hours must settle for himself
is at what time of day he will make his
principal effort; for the day of every intellectual
workman ought to be marked by a kind
of artistic composition; there ought to be
some one labor distinctly recognized as dominant,
with others in subordination, and subordination
of various degrees. Now for the
hours at which the principal effort ought to
be made, it is not possible to fix them by
the clock so as to be suitable for everybody,
but a broad rule may be arrived at which is
applicable to all imaginable cases. The rule
is this&mdash;to do the chief work in the best hours;
to give it the pick of your day; and by day
I do not mean only the solar day, but the
whole of the twenty-four hours. There is an
important physiological reason for giving the
best hours to the most important work. The
better the condition of the brain and the body,
and the more favorable the surrounding circumstances,
the smaller will be the cost to
the organization of the labor that has to be
done. It is always the safest way to do the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>479</span>
heaviest (or most important) work at the
time and under the conditions which make it
the least costly.</p>

<p>Physicians are unanimous in their preference
of early to late work; and no doubt, if
the question were not complicated by other
considerations, we could not do better than to
follow their advice in its simplicity. Goethe
wrote in the morning, with his faculties refreshed
by sleep and not yet excited by any
stimulant. I could mention several living
authors of eminence who pursue the same
plan, and find it favorable alike to health
and to production. The rule which they follow
is never to write after lunch, leaving
the rest of their time free for study
and society, both of which are absolutely
necessary to authors. According to this
system it is presumed that the hours between
breakfast and lunch are the best
hours. In many cases they are so. A person
in fair health, after taking a light
early breakfast without any heavier stimulant
than tea or coffee, finds himself in a
state of freshness highly favorable to sound
and agreeable thinking. His brain will be in
still finer order if the breakfast has been preceded
by a cold bath, with friction and a little
exercise. The feeling of freshness, cleanliness,
and moderate exhilaration, will last for
several hours, and during those hours the intellectual
work will probably be both lively
and reasonable. It is difficult for a man who
feels cheerful and refreshed, and whose task
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>480</span>
seems easy and light, to write anything morbid
or perverse.</p>

<p>But for the morning to be so good as I have
just described it, the workman must be quite
favorably situated. He ought to live in a
very tranquil neighborhood, and to be as free
as possible from anxiety as to what the postman
may have in reserve for him. If his
study-window looks out on a noisy street, and
if the day is sure, as it wears on, to bring
anxious business of its own, then the increasing
noise and the apprehension (even though
it be almost entirely unconscious) of impending
business, will be quite sufficient to interfere
with the work of any man who is the
least in the world nervous, and almost all intellectual
laborers <i>are</i> nervous, more or less.
Men who have the inestimable advantage of
absolute tranquillity, at all times, do well to
work in the morning, but those who can only
get tranquillity at times independent of their
own choice have a strong reason for working
at those times, whether they happen to be in
the morning or not.</p>

<p>In an excellent article on &ldquo;Work&rdquo; (evidently
written by an experienced intellectual
workman), which appeared in one of the early
numbers of the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, and was
remarkable alike for practical wisdom and
the entire absence of traditional dogmatism,
the writer speaks frankly in favor of night-work,
&ldquo;If you can work at all at night, one
hour at that time is worth any two in the
morning. The house is hushed, the brain is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>481</span>
clear, the distracting influences of the day
are at an end. You have not to disturb yourself
with thoughts of what you are about to
do, or what you are about to suffer. You
know that there is a gulf between you and
the affairs of the outside world, almost like
the chasm of death; and that you need not
take thought of the morrow until the morrow
has come. There are few really great
thoughts, such as the world will not willingly
let die, that have not been conceived under
the quiet stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The medical objection to night-work in the
case of literary men would probably be that
the night is <i>too</i> favorable to literary production.
The author of the Essay just quoted
says that at night &ldquo;you only drift into deeper
silence <i>and quicker inspiration</i>. If the
right mood is upon you, <i>you write on</i>; if not,
your pillow awaits you.&rdquo; Exactly so; that is
to say, the brain, owing to the complete external
tranquillity, can so concentrate its efforts
on the subject in hand as to work itself
up into a luminous condition which is fed by
the most rapid destruction of the nervous
substance that ever takes place within the
walls of a human skull. &ldquo;If the right mood
is upon you, <i>you write on</i>;&rdquo; in other words,
if you have once well lighted your spirit-lamp,
it will go on burning so long as any spirit is
left in it, for the air is so tranquil that nothing
comes to blow it out. You drift into
deeper silence and &ldquo;quicker inspiration.&rdquo; It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>482</span>
is just this quicker inspiration that the physician
dreads.</p>

<p>Against this objection may be placed the
equally serious objection to day-work, that
every interruption, when you are particularly
anxious not to be interrupted, causes a definite
loss and injury to the nervous system.
The choice must therefore be made between
two dangers, and if they are equally balanced
there can be no hesitation, because all the <i>literary</i>
interests of an author are on the side of
the most tranquil time. Literary work is always
sure to be much better done when there
is no fear of disturbance than under the apprehension
of it; and precisely the same
amount of cerebral effort will produce, when
the work is uninterrupted, not only better
writing, but a much greater quantity of writing.
The knowledge that he is working well
and productively is an element of health to
every workman because it encourages cheerful
habits of mind.</p>

<p>In the division of time it is an excellent rule
for adults to keep it as much as possible <i>in
large masses</i>, not giving a quarter of an hour
to one occupation and a quarter to another,
but giving three, four, or five hours to one
thing at a time. In the case of children an
opposite practice should be followed; they are
able to change their attention from one subject
to another much more easily than we can,
whilst at the same time they cannot fix their
minds for very long without cerebral fatigue
leading to temporary incapacity. The custom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>483</span>
prevalent in schools, of making the boys learn
several different things in the course of the
day, is therefore founded upon the necessities
of the boy-nature, though most grown men
would find that changes so frequent would,
for them, have all the inconveniences of interruption.
To boys they come as relief, to men
as interruption. The reason is that the physical
condition of the brain is different in the
two cases; but in our loose way of talking
about these things we may say that the boy&rsquo;s
ideas are superficial, like the plates and dishes
on the surface of a dinner-table, which may
be rapidly changed without inconvenience,
whereas the man&rsquo;s ideas, having all struck
root down to the very depths of his nature, are
more like the plants in a garden, which cannot
be removed without a temporary loss both
of vigor and of beauty, and the loss cannot be
instantaneously repaired. For a man to do his
work thoroughly well, it is necessary that he
should dwell in it long enough at a time to get
all the powers of his mind fully under command
with reference to the particular work
in hand, and he cannot do this without tuning
his whole mind to the given diapason, as a
tuner tunes a piano. Some men can tune
their minds more rapidly, as violins are tuned,
and this faculty may to a certain extent be acquired
by efforts of the will very frequently
repeated. Cuvier had this faculty in the most
eminent degree. One of his biographers says:
&ldquo;His extreme facility for study, and of directing
all the powers of his mind to diverse occupations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>484</span>
of study, from one quarter of an hour
to another, was one of the most extraordinary
qualities of his mind.&rdquo; The Duke of Wellington
also cultivated the habit (inestimably valuable
to a public man) of directing the whole
of his attention to the subject under consideration,
however frequently that subject might
happen to be changed. But although men of
exceptional power and very exceptional flexibility
may do this with apparent impunity,
that still depends very much on the nature of
the occupation. There are some occupations
which are not incompatible with a fragmentary
division of time, because these occupations
are themselves fragmentary. For example,
you may study languages in phrase-books
during very small spaces of time, because
the complete phrase is in itself a very
small thing, but you could not so easily break
and resume the thread of an elaborate argument.
I suspect that though Cuvier appeared
to his contemporaries a man remarkably able
to leave off and resume his work at will, he
must have taken care to do work that would
bear interruption at those times when he knew
himself to be most liable to it. And although,
when a man&rsquo;s time is unavoidably broken up
into fragments, no talent of a merely auxiliary
kind can be more precious than that of
turning each of those fragments to advantage,
it is still true that he whose time is at
his own disposal will do his work most calmly,
most deliberately, and therefore on the whole
most thoroughly and perfectly, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>485</span>
keeps it in fine masses. The mere knowledge
that you have three or four clear hours before
you is in itself a great help to the spirit of
thoroughness, both in study and in production.
It is agreeable too, when the sitting has come
to an end, to perceive that a definite advance
is the result of it, and advance in anything is
scarcely perceptible in less than three or four
hours.</p>

<p>There are several pursuits which <i>cannot</i> be
followed in fragments of time, on account of
the necessary preparations. It is useless to
begin oil-painting unless you have full time
to set your palette properly, to get your canvas
into a proper state for working upon, to
pose the model as you wish, and settle down
to work with everything as it ought to be.
In landscape-painting from nature you require
the time to go to the selected place, and
after your arrival to arrange your materials
and shelter yourself from the sun. In scientific
pursuits the preparations are usually at
least equally elaborate, and often much more
so. To prepare for an experiment, or for a
dissection, takes time which we feel to be disproportionate
when it leaves too little for the
scientific work itself. It is for this reason
more frequently than for any other that amateurs
who begin in enthusiasm, so commonly,
after a while, abandon the objects of their
pursuit.</p>

<p>There is a kind of slavery to which no
really intellectual man would ever voluntarily
submit, a minute obedience to the clock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>486</span>
Very conscientious people often impose upon
themselves this sort of slavery. A person
who has hampered himself with rules of this
kind will take up a certain book, for instance,
when the clock strikes nine, and begin at yesterday&rsquo;s
mark, perhaps in the middle of a
paragraph. Then he will read with great
steadiness till a quarter-past nine, and exactly
on the instant when the minute-hand gets opposite
the dot, he will shut his book, however
much the passage may happen to interest him.
It was in allusion to good people of this kind
that Sir Walter Scott said he had never
known a man of genius who could be perfectly
regular in his habits, whilst he had
known many blockheads who could. It is
easy to see that a minute obedience to the
clock is unintellectual in its very nature, for
the intellect is not a piece of mechanism as a
clock is, and cannot easily be made to act
like one. There may be perfect correspondence
between the locomotives and the clocks
on a railway, for if the clocks are pieces of
mechanism the locomotives are so likewise,
but the intellect always needs a certain looseness
and latitude as to time. Very broad
rules are the best, such as &ldquo;Write in the
morning, read in the afternoon, see friends in
the evening,&rdquo; or else &ldquo;Study one day and produce
another, alternately,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Work
one week and see the world another week,
alternately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a fretting habit, much recommended
by men of business and of great use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>487</span>
to them, of writing the evening before the
duties of the day in a book of agenda. If
this is done at all by intellectual men with
reference to their pursuits, it ought to be
done in a very broad, loose way, never minutely.
An intellectual worker ought never
to make it a matter of conscience (in intellectual
labor) to do a predetermined quantity
of little things. This sort of conscientiousness
frets and worries, and is the enemy of all serenity
of thought.</p>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF ABILITY AND CULTURE
WHO HAD NOT DECIDED ABOUT HIS PROFESSION.</h5>

<p class="pro">The Church&mdash;Felicities and advantages of the clerical profession&mdash;Its
elevated ideal&mdash;That it is favorable to noble studies&mdash;French
priests and English Clergymen&mdash;The professional
point of view&mdash;Difficulty of disinterested thinking&mdash;Colored

included in the fine arts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> may be taken for granted that to a mind
constituted as yours is, no profession will be
satisfactory which does not afford free play
to the intellectual powers. You might no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>489</span>
doubt exercise resolution enough to bind
yourself down to uncongenial work for a
term of years, but it would be with the intention
of retiring as soon as you had realized a
competency. The happiest life is that which
constantly exercises and educates what is
best in us.</p>

<p>You had thoughts, at one time, of the
Church, and the Church would have suited
you in many respects very happily, yet not,
I think, in all respects. The clerical profession
has many great felicities and advantages:
it educates and develops, by its mild but
regular discipline, much of our higher nature;
it sets before us an elevated ideal, worth striving
for at the cost of every sacrifice but one,
of which I intend to say something farther
on; and it offers just that mixture of public
and private life which best affords the alternation
of activity and rest. It is an existence
in many respects most favorable to the noblest
studies. It offers the happiest combination
of duties that satisfy the conscience with
leisure for the cultivation of the mind; it
gives the easiest access to all classes of society,
providing for the parson himself a neutral
and independent position, so safe that he need
only conduct himself properly to preserve it.
How superior, from the intellectual point of
view, is this liberal existence to the narrower
one of a French <i>curé de campagne</i>! I certainly
think that if a good <i>curé</i> has an exceptional
genius for <span class="correction" title="amended from sancitity">sanctity</span>, his chances of becoming
a perfect saint are better than those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page490" id="page490"></a>490</span>
of a comfortable English incumbent, who is
at the same time a gentleman and man of the
world, but he is not nearly so well situated
for leading the intellectual life. Our own
clergy have a sort of middle position between
the <i>curé</i> and the layman, which without at
all interfering with their spiritual vocation,
makes them better judges of the character of
laymen and more completely in sympathy
with it.</p>

<p>And yet, although the life of a clergyman
is favorable to culture in many ways, it is
not wholly favorable to it. There exists, in
clerical thinking generally, just one restriction
or impediment, which is the overwhelming
importance of the professional point of
view. Of all the professions the ecclesiastical
one is that which most decidedly and most
constantly affects the judgment of persons
and opinions. It is peculiarly difficult for a
clergyman to attain disinterestedness in his
thinking, to accept truth just as it may happen
to present itself, without passionately desiring
that one doctrine may turn out to be
strong in evidence and another unsupported.
And so we find the clergy, as a class, anxious
rather to discover aids to faith, than the simple
scientific truth; and the more the special
priestly character develops itself, the more
we find them disposed to use their intellects
for the triumph of principles that are decided
upon beforehand. Sometimes this disposition
leads them to see the acts of laymen in a colored
light and to speak of them without strict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id="page491"></a>491</span>
accuracy. Here is an example of what I
mean. A Jesuit priest preached a sermon in
London very recently, in which he said that
&ldquo;in Germany, France, Italy, and England,
gigantic efforts were being made to rob Christian
children of the blessing of a Christian
education.&rdquo; &ldquo;Herod, though dead,&rdquo; the
preacher continued, &ldquo;has left his mantle behind
him; and I wish that the soldiers of
Herod in those countries would plunge their
swords into the breasts of little children while
they were innocent, rather than have their
souls destroyed by means of an unchristian
and uncatholic education.&rdquo; No doubt this is
very earnest and sincere, but it is not accurate
and just thinking. The laity in the
countries the preacher mentioned have certainly
a strong tendency to exclude theology
from State schools, because it is so difficult
for a modern State to impose any kind of theological
teaching without injustice to minorities;
but the laity do not desire to deprive
children of whatever instruction may be
given to them by the clergy of their respective
communions. May I add, that to
the mind of a layman it seems a sanguinary
desire that all little children should have
swords plunged into their breasts rather than
be taught in schools not clerically directed?
The exact truth is, that the powerful lay element
is certainly separating itself from the
ecclesiastical element all over Europe, because
it is found by experience that the two
have a great and increasing difficulty in working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>492</span>
harmoniously together, but the ecclesiastical
element is detached and not destroyed.
The quotation I have just made is in itself a
sufficient illustration of that very peculiarity
in the more exalted ecclesiastical temperament,
which often makes it so difficult for
priests and governments, in these times, to
get on comfortably together. Here is first a
very inaccurate statement, and then an outburst
of most passionate feeling, whereas the
intellect desires the strictest truth and the
most complete disinterestedness. As the temper
of the laity becomes more and more intellectual
(and that is the direction of its movement),
the sacerdotal habit will become more
and more remote from it.</p>

<p>The clerical life has many strong attractions
for the intellectual, and just one drawback
to counterbalance them. It offers tranquillity,
shelter from the interruptions and
anxieties of the more active professions, and
powerful means of influence ready to hand;
but it is compatible with intellectual freedom
and with the satisfaction of the conscience,
only just so long as the priest really remains a
believer in the details of his religion. Now, although
we may reasonably hope to retain the
chief elements of our belief, although what a
man believes at twenty-five is always what
he will most probably believe at fifty, still, in
an age when free inquiry is the common
habit of cultivated people of our sex, we may
well hesitate before taking upon ourselves
any formal engagement for the future, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>493</span>
in matters of detail. The intellectual
spirit does not regard its conclusions as being
at any time final, but always provisional; we
hold what we believe to be the truth until we
can replace it by some more perfect truth,
but cannot tell how much of to-day&rsquo;s beliefs
to-morrow will retain or reject. It may be
observed, however, that the regular performance
of priestly functions is in itself a great
help to permanence in belief by connecting it
closely with practical habit, so that the clergy
do really and honestly often retain through
life their hold on early beliefs which as laymen
they might have lost.</p>

<p>The profession of the law provides ample
opportunities for a critical intellect with a
strong love of accuracy and a robust capacity
for hard work, besides which it is the best
of worldly educations. Some lawyers love
their work as passionately as artists do
theirs, others dislike it very heartily, most of
them seem to take it as a simple business to
be done for daily bread. Lawyers whose
heart is in their work are invariably men of
superior ability, which proves that there is
something in it that affords gratification to
the intellectual powers. However, in speaking
of lawyers, I feel ignorant and on the outside,
because their profession is one of which
the interior feelings can be known to no one
who has not practised. One thing seems
clear, they get the habit of employing the
whole strength and energy of their minds for
especial and temporary ends, the purpose being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>494</span>
the service of the client, certainly not the
revelation of pure truth. Hence, although
they become very acute, and keen judges of
that side of human nature which they habitually
see (not the best side), they are not more
disinterested than clergymen.<a name="FnAnchor_12" id="FnAnchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Sometimes
they take up some study outside of their profession
and follow it disinterestedly, but this
is rare. A busy lawyer is much more likely
than a clergyman to become entirely absorbed
in his professional life, because it requires so
much more intellectual exertion. I remember
asking a very clever lawyer who lived in London,
whether he ever visited an exhibition of
pictures, and he answered me by the counter-inquiry
whether I had read Chitty on Contracts,
Collier on Partnerships, Taylor on Evidence,
Cruse&rsquo;s Digest, or Smith&rsquo;s Mercantile
Law? This seemed to me at the time a good
instance of the way a professional habit may
narrow one&rsquo;s views of things, for these law-books
were written for lawyers alone, whilst
the picture exhibitions were intended for the
public generally. My friend&rsquo;s answer would
have been more to the point if I had inquired
whether he had read Linton on Colors, and
Burnet on Chiaroscuro.</p>

<p>There is just one situation in which we all
may feel for a short time as lawyers feel habitually.
Suppose that two inexperienced
players sit down to a game of chess, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page495" id="page495"></a>495</span>
each is backed by a clever person who is constantly
giving him hints. The two backers
represent the lawyers, and the players represent
their clients. There is not much disinterested
thought in a situation of this kind,
but there is a strong stimulus to acuteness.</p>

<p>I think that lawyers are often superior to
philosophers in their sense of what is relatively
important in human affairs with reference to
limited spaces of time, such as half a century.
They especially know the enormous importance
of custom, which the speculative mind
very readily forgets, and they have in the
highest degree that peculiar sense which fits
men for dealing with others in the affairs of
ordinary life. In this respect they are remarkably
superior to clergymen, and superior also
to artists and men of science.</p>

<p>The profession of medicine is, of all fairly
lucrative professions, the one best suited to the
development of the intellectual life. Having
to deal continually with science, being constantly
engaged in following and observing
the operation of natural laws, it produces a
sense of the working of those laws which prepares
the mind for bold and original speculation,
and a reliance upon their unfailing regularity,
which gives it great firmness and assurance.
A medical education is the best
possible preparation for philosophical pursuits,
because it gives them a solid basis in
the ascertainable. The estimation in which
these studies are held is an accurate meter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>496</span>
the intellectual advancement of a community.
When the priest is reverenced as a being above
ordinary humanity, and the physician slightly
esteemed, the condition of society is sure to
be that of comparative ignorance and barbarism;
and it is one of several signs which indicate
barbarian feeling in our own aristocracy,
that it has a contempt for the study of
medicine. The progress of society towards
enlightenment is marked by the steady social
rise of the surgeon and the physician, a rise
which still continues, even in Western Europe.
It is probable that before very long the medical
profession will exercise a powerful influence
upon general education, and take an
active share in it. There are very strong reasons
for the opinion that schoolmasters educated
in medicine would be peculiarly well
qualified to train both body and mind for a
vigorous and active manhood. An immense
advantage, even from the intellectual point of
view, in the pursuit of medicine and surgery,
is that they supply a discipline in mental
heroism. Other professions do this also, but
not to the same degree. The combination of
an accurate training in positive science with
the habitual contempt of danger and contemplation
of suffering and death, is the finest
possible preparation for noble studies and
arduous discoveries. I ought to add, however,
that medical men in the provinces, when they
have not any special enthusiasm for their
work, seem peculiarly liable to the deadening
influences of routine, and easily fall behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id="page497"></a>497</span>
their age. The medical periodicals provide
the best remedy for this.</p>

<p>The military and naval professions are too
active, and too much bound to obedience in
their activity, for the highest intellectual pursuits;
but their greatest evil in this respect is
the continual privation of solitude, and the
frequency of interruption. A soldier&rsquo;s life in
the higher ranks, when there is great responsibility
and the necessity for personal decision,
undoubtedly leads to the most brilliant employment
of the mental powers, and develops
a manliness of character which is often of the
greatest use in intellectual work; so that a
man of science may find his force augmented,
and better under control, for having passed
through a military experience; but the life of
barracks and camps is destructive to continuity
of thinking. The incompatibility becomes
strikingly manifest when we reflect how
impossible it would have been for Ney or Massena
to do the work of Cuvier or Comte.
Cuvier even declined to accompany the expedition
to Egypt, notwithstanding the prospects
of advantage that it offered. The reason
he gave for this refusal was, that he
could do more for science in the tranquillity
of the Jardin des Plantes. He was a strict
economist of time, and dreaded the loss of it
involved in following an army, even though
his mission would have been purely scientific.
How much more would Cuvier have dreaded
the interruptions of a really military existence!
It is these interruptions, and not any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>498</span>
want of natural ability, that are the true explanation
of the intellectual poverty which
characterizes the military profession. Of all
the liberal professions it is the least studious.</p>

<p>Let me say a word in conclusion about the
practical pursuit of the fine arts. Painters
are often remarkable for pleasant conversational
power, and a degree of intelligence
strikingly superior to their literary culture.
This is because the processes of their art can
be followed, at least under certain circumstances,
by the exercise of hand and eye,
directed merely by artistic taste and experience,
whilst the intellect is left free either for
reflection or conversation. Rubens liked to
be read to when he painted; many artists
like to hear people talk, and to take a share
occasionally in the conversation. The truth
is that artists, even when they work very assiduously,
do in fact enjoy great spaces of
intellectual leisure, and often profit by them.
Painting itself is also a fine discipline for
some of the best faculties of the mind, though
it is well known that the most gifted artists
think least about their art. Still there is a
large class of painters, including many eminent
ones, who <i>proceed intellectually</i> in the
execution of their works, who reason them
out philosophically step by step, and exercise
a continual criticism upon their manual labor
as it goes forward. I find, as I know art and
artists better, that this class is more numerous
than is commonly suspected, and that the
charming effects which we believe to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>499</span>
result of pure inspiration have often been
elaborately reasoned out like a problem in
mathematics. We are very apt to forget that
art includes a great science, the science of
natural appearances, and that the technical
work of painters and engravers cannot go
forward safely without the profoundest knowledge
of certain delicate materials, this being
also a science, and a difficult one. The common
tendency is to underrate (from ignorance)
what is intellectual in the practice of the
fine arts; and yet the artists of past times
have left evidence enough that they thought
about art, and thought deeply. Artists are
often illiterate; but it is possible to be at the
same time illiterate and intellectual; as we
see frequent examples of book-learning in
people who have scarcely a single idea of
their own.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO HAD LITERARY
AND ARTISTIC TASTES, BUT NO PROFESSION.</h5>

<p class="pro">The world only recognizes performance&mdash;Uselessness of botch-work&mdash;Vastness
of the interval between botch-work and
handicraft&mdash;Delusions of the well-to-do&mdash;Quotation from
Charles Lever&mdash;Indifference, and even contempt, for skill&mdash;Moral
contempt for skill&mdash;The contempt which comes
from the pride of knowledge&mdash;Intellectual value of skill
and of professional discipline.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is not a graceful thing for me to say, nor
pleasant for you to hear, that what you have
done hitherto in art and literature is neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>500</span>
of any value in itself nor likely to lead you
to that which is truly and permanently satisfying.
I believe you have natural ability,
though it would not be easy for any critic to
measure its degree when it has never been
developed by properly-directed work. Most
critics would probably err on the unfavorable
side, for we are easily blind to powers that
are little more than latent. To see anything
encouraging in your present performance, it
would need the sympathy and intelligence of
the American sculptor Greenough, of whom
it was said that &ldquo;his recognition was not limited
to achievement, but extended to latent
powers.&rdquo; The world, however, recognizes
nothing short of performance, because the
performance is what it needs, and promises
are of no use to it.</p>

<p>In this rough justice of the world there is a
natural distribution of rewards. You will be
paid, in fame and money, for all excellent
work; and you will be paid, in money, though
not in fame, for all work that is even simply
good, provided it be of a kind that the world
needs, or fancies that it needs. But you will
never be paid at all for botch-work, neither
in money nor in fame, nor by your own inward
approval.</p>

<p>For we all of us either know that our botch-work
is worthless, or else have serious misgivings
about it. That which is less commonly
realized by those who have not undergone
the test of professional labor is the vastness
of the interval that separates botch-work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>501</span>
from handicraft, and the difficulty of getting
over it. &ldquo;There are few delusions,&rdquo; Charles
Lever said in &ldquo;The Bramleighs,&rdquo; &ldquo;more
common with well-to-do people than the belief
that if &lsquo;put to it&rsquo; they could earn their
own livelihood in a variety of ways. Almost
every man has some two or three or more accomplishments
which he fancies would be
quite adequate to his support; and remembering
with what success the exercise of
these gifts has ever been hailed in the society
of his friends, he has a sort of generous dislike
to be obliged to eclipse some poor drudge
of a professional, who, of course, will be consigned
to utter oblivion after his own performance.
Augustus Bramleigh was certainly
not a conceited or a vain man, and yet he
had often in his palmy days imagined how
easy it would be for him to provide for his
own support. He was something of a musician;
he sang pleasingly; he drew a little; he
knew something of three or four modern languages;
he had that sort of smattering acquaintance
with questions of religion, politics,
and literature which the world calls being
&lsquo;well-informed,&rsquo; and yet nothing short of
the grave necessity revealed to him that towards
the object of securing a livelihood a
cobbler in his bulk was out-and-out his master.
The world has no need of the man of
small acquirements, and would rather have
its shoes mended by the veriest botch of a
professional than by the cleverest amateur
that ever studied a Greek sandal.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>502</span> </p>

<p>Something of this illusion, which Charles
Lever has touched so truly, may be due to a
peculiarity of the English mind in its present
(not quite satisfactory) stage of development,
a peculiarity which I am not the first to point
out, since it has been already indicated by
Mr. Pointer, the distinguished artist; and I
think that this peculiarity is to be found in
very great force, perhaps in greater force than
elsewhere, in that well-to-do English middle
class in which you have been born and educated.
It consists in a sort of indifference to
skill of all kinds, which passes into something
not very far from active contempt when a
call is made for attention, recognition, admiration.
The source of this feeling will probably
be found in the inordinate respect for
wealth, between which and highly developed
personal skill, in anything, there is a certain
antagonism or incompatibility. The men of
real skill are almost always men who earn
their living by their skill. The feeling of the
middle-class capitalists concerning the skilful
man may be expressed, not unjustly, as follows:
&ldquo;Yes, he is very clever; he may well
be clever&mdash;it is his trade; he gets his living
by it.&rdquo; This is held to exonerate us from the
burden of admiration, and there is not any serious
interest in the achievements of human
endeavor as evidence of the marvellous natural
endowments and capabilities of the human
organism. In some minds the indifference to
skill is more active and grows into very real,
though not openly expressed contempt. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id="page503"></a>503</span>
contempt is partly moral. The skilful man
always rejoices in his skill with a heaven-bestowed
joy and delight&mdash;one of the purest and
most divine pleasures given by God to man&mdash;an
encouragement to labor, and a reward, the
best reward, after his arduous apprenticeship.
But there is a sour and severe spirit, hating
all innocent pleasures, which despises the
gladness of the skilful as so much personal
vanity.</p>

<p>There is also the contempt for skill which
comes from the pride of knowledge. To attain
skill <i>in</i> anything a degree of application
is necessary which absorbs more time than
the acquisition of knowledge <i>about</i> the thing,
so that the remarkably skilful man is not
likely to be the erudite man. There have
been instances of men who possessed both
skill and learning. The American sculptor
Greenough, and the English painter Dyce,
were at the same time both eminently skilful
in their craft and eminently learned out of
it; but the combination is very rare. Therefore
the possession of skill has come to be considered
presumptive evidence of a want of
general information.</p>

<p>But the truth is that professional skill is
knowledge tested and perfected by practical
application, and therefore has a great intellectual
value. Professional life is to private
individuals what active warfare is to a military
state. It brings to light every deficiency,
and reveals our truest needs. And therefore
it seems to me a matter for regret that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>504</span>
should pass your existence in irresponsible
privacy, and not have your attainments
tested by the exigencies of some professional
career. The discipline which such a career
affords, and which no private resolution can
ever adequately replace, may be all that is
wanting to your development.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO WISHED TO DEVOTE
HIMSELF TO LITERATURE AS A PROFESSION.</h5>

<p class="pro">Byron&rsquo;s vexation at the idea of poetry being considered a
profession&mdash;Buffon could not bear to be called a naturalist&mdash;Cuvier
would not be called a Hellenist&mdash;Faraday&rsquo;s
life not professional&mdash;The intellectual life frequently protected
by professions outside of it&mdash;Professional work
ought to be plain business work&mdash;Michelet&rsquo;s account of
the incubation of a book&mdash;Necessity for too great rapidity
of production in professional literature&mdash;It does not pay to
do your best&mdash;Journalism and magazine-writing&mdash;Illustration
from a sister art&mdash;Privilege of an author to be allowed
to write little.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Do</span> you remember how put out Byron was
when some reviewer spoke of Wordsworth as
being &ldquo;at the head of the profession&rdquo;? Byron&rsquo;s
vexation was not entirely due to jealousy
of Wordsworth, though that may have
had something to do with it, nor was it due
either to an aristocratic dislike of being in a
&ldquo;profession&rdquo; himself, though this feeling may
have had a certain influence; it was due to
a proper sense of the dignity of the intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>505</span>
life. Buffon could not bear to be called a
&ldquo;naturalist,&rdquo; and Cuvier in the same way
disliked the title of Hellenist, because it
sounded professional: he said that though he
knew more Greek than all the Academy he
was not a Hellenist as Gail was, because he
did not live by Greek.</p>

<p>Now, if this feeling had arisen merely from
a dislike to having it supposed that one is
obliged to earn his own living, it would have
been a contemptibly vulgar sentiment, whoever
professed it. Nothing can be more honorable
to a man than to earn his bread by
honest industry of any kind, whether it be
manual or intellectual, and still I feel with
Byron, and Buffon, and Cuvier, that the great
instruments of the world&rsquo;s intellectual culture
ought not to be, in the ordinary sense, professions.
Byron said that poetry, as he understood
it, was &ldquo;an art, an attribute,&rdquo; but not
what is understood by a &ldquo;profession.&rdquo; Surely
the same is true of all the highest intellectual
work, in whatever kind. You could scarcely
consider Faraday&rsquo;s life to be what is commonly
understood by a professional life. Tyndall
says that if Faraday had chosen to employ
his talents in analytical chemistry he
might have realized a fortune of 150,000<i>l.</i>
Now that would have been a professional existence;
but the career which Faraday chose
(happily for science) was not professional, but
intellectual. The distinction between the
professional and the intellectual lives is perfectly
clear in my own mind, and therefore I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>506</span>
ought to be able to express it clearly. Let
me make the attempt.</p>

<p>The purpose of a profession, of a profession
pure and simple, is to turn knowledge and
talent to pecuniary profit. On the other hand,
the purpose of cultivated men, or men of genius,
who work in an unprofessional spirit, is
to increase knowledge, or make it more accurate,
or else simply to give free exercise to
high faculties which demand it. The distinction
is so clear and trenchant that most intellectual
men, whose private fortunes are not
large, prefer to have a profession distinct
from their higher intellectual work, in order
to secure the perfect independence of the latter.
Mr. Smiles, in his valuable book on
&ldquo;Character,&rdquo; gives a list of eminent intellectual
men who have pursued real professional
avocations of various kinds separately from
their literary or scientific activity, and he
mentions an observation of Gifford&rsquo;s which is
much to my present purpose:&mdash;&ldquo;Gifford, the
editor of the <i>Quarterly</i>, who knew the drudgery
of writing for a living, once observed that
&lsquo;a single hour of composition, won from the
business of the day, is worth more than the
whole day&rsquo;s toil of him who works at the
trade of literature: in the one case, the spirit
comes joyfully to refresh itself, like a hart to
the water-brooks; in the other, it pursues its
miserable way, panting and jaded, with the
dogs of hunger and necessity behind.&rsquo;&rdquo; So
Coleridge said that &ldquo;three hours of leisure,
unalloyed by any alien anxiety, and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>507</span>
forward to with delight as a change and recreation,
will suffice to realize in literature a
larger product of what is truly genial than
weeks of compulsion.&rdquo; Coleridge&rsquo;s idea of a
profession was, that it should be &ldquo;some regular
employment which could be carried on so
far mechanically, that an average quantum
only of health, spirits, and intellectual exertion
are requisite to its faithful discharge.&rdquo;
Without in the least desiring to undervalue
good professional work of any kind, I may
observe that, to be truly professional, it ought
to be always at command, and therefore that
the average power of the man&rsquo;s intellect, not
his rare flashes of highest intellectual illumination,
ought to suffice for it. Professional
work ought always to be plain business work,
requiring knowledge and skill, but not any
effort of genius. For example, in medicine, it
is professional work to prescribe a dose or amputate
a limb, but not to discover the nervous
system or the circulation of the blood.</p>

<p>If literature paid sufficiently well to allow
it, a literary man might very wisely consider
<i>study</i> to be his profession, and not production.
He would then study regularly, say, six
hours a day, and write when he had something
to say, and really wanted to express it.
His book, when it came out, would have had
time to be properly hatched, and would probably
have natural life in it. Michelet says of
one of his books: &ldquo;Cette &oelig;uvre a du moins
le caractère d&rsquo;être venue comme vient toute
vraie création vivante. Elle s&rsquo;est faite à la
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>508</span>
chaleur d&rsquo;une douce incubation.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_13" id="FnAnchor_13" href="#Footnote_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> It would
be impossible, in so short a space, to give a
more accurate description of the natural manner
in which a book comes into existence. A
book ought always to be &ldquo;fait à la chaleur
d&rsquo;une douce incubation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when you make a profession of literature
this is what you can hardly ever get
leave to do. Literary men require to see
something of the world; they can hardly be
hermits, and the world cannot be seen without
a constant running expenditure, which at
the end of the year represents an income.
Men of culture and refinement really <i>cannot</i>
live like very poor people without deteriorating
in refinement, and falling behind in
knowledge of the world. When they are
married, and have families, they can hardly
let their families live differently from themselves;
so that there are the usual expenses of
the English professional classes to be met, and
these are heavy when they have to be got out
of the profits of literature. The consequence
is, that if a book is to be written prudently it
must be written quickly, and with the least
amount of preparatory labor that can possibly
be made to serve. This is very different from
the &ldquo;<i>douce incubation</i>&rdquo; of Michelet. Goldsmith
said of hack-writing, that it was difficult
to imagine a combination more prejudicial
to taste than that of the author whose interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>509</span>
it is to write as much as possible, and
the bookseller, whose interest it is to pay as
little as possible. The condition of authors
has no doubt greatly improved since Goldsmith&rsquo;s
time, but still the fact remains that
the most careful and finished writing, requiring
extensive preparatory study, is a luxury
in which the professional writer can only indulge
himself at great risk. Careful writing
does, no doubt, occasionally pay for the time
it costs; but such writing is more commonly
done by men who are either independent by
fortune, or who make themselves, as authors,
independent by the pursuit of some other profession,
than by regular men of letters whose
whole income is derived from their inkstands.
And when, by way of exception, the hack-writer
does produce very highly-finished and
concentrated work, based upon an elaborate
foundation of hard study, that work is seldom
professional in the strictest sense, but is
a labor of love, outside the hasty journalism
or magazine-writing that wins his daily bread.
In cases of this kind it is clear that the best
work is not done as a regular part of professional
duty, and that the author might as well
earn his bread in some other calling, if he still
had the same amount of leisure for the composition
of real literature.</p>

<p>The fault I find with writing as a profession
is that <i>it does not pay to do your best</i>. I don&rsquo;t
mean to insinuate that downright slovenly or
careless work is the most profitable; but I do
mean to say that any high degree of conscientiousness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>510</span>
especially in the way of study and
research, is a direct injury to the professional
writer&rsquo;s purse. Suppose, for example, that he
is engaged in reviewing a book, and is to get
3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> for the review when it is written. If
by the accident of previous accumulation his
knowledge is already fully equal to the demand
upon it, the review may be written rapidly,
and the day&rsquo;s work will have been a profitable
one; but if, on the other hand, it is necessary
to consult several authorities, to make
some laborious researches, then the reviewer is
placed in a dilemma between literary thoroughness
and duty to his family. He cannot
spend a week in reading up a subject for the
sum of 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> Is it not much easier to string
together a few phrases which will effectually
hide his ignorance from everybody but the
half-dozen enthusiasts who have mastered the
subject of the book? It is strange that the
professional pursuit of literature should be a
direct discouragement to study; yet it is so.
There <i>are</i> hack-writers who study, and they
deserve much honor for doing so, since the
temptations the other way are always so pressing
and immediate. Sainte-Beuve was a true
student, loving literature for its own sake, and
preparing for his articles with a diligence rare
in the profession. But he was scarcely a hack-writer,
having a modest independency, and
living besides with the quiet frugality of a
bachelor.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be that literature of the
highest kind can only in the most exceptional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511"></a>511</span>
cases be made a profession, yet that a skilful
writer may use his pen professionally if he
chooses. The production of the printed talk
of the day <i>is</i> a profession, requiring no more
than average ability, and the tone and temper
of ordinary educated men. The outcome of
it is journalism and magazine-writing; and
now let me say a word or two about these.</p>

<p>The highest kind of journalism is very well
done in England; the men who do it are often
either highly educated, or richly gifted by
nature, or both. The practice of journalism
is useful to an author in giving him a degree
of readiness and rapidity, a skill in turning
his materials to immediate account, and a
power of presenting one or two points effectively,
which may often be valuable in literature
of a more permanent order. The danger
of it may be illustrated by a reference to a
sister art. I was in the studio of an English
landscape-painter when some pictures arrived
from an artist in the country to go along with
his own to one of the exhibitions. They were
all very pretty and very clever&mdash;indeed, so
clever were they, that their cleverness was almost
offensive&mdash;and so long as they were
looked at by themselves, the brilliance of them
was rather dazzling. But the instant they
were placed by the side of thoroughly careful
and earnest work, it became strikingly evident
that they had been painted hastily, and
would be almost immediately exhausted by
the purchaser. Now these pictures were the
<i>journalism of painting</i>; and my friend told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>512</span>
me that when once an artist has got into the
habit of doing hasty work like that, he seldom
acquires better habits afterwards.</p>

<p>Professional writers who follow journalism
for its immediate profits, are liable in like manner
to retain the habit of diffuseness in literature
which ought to be more finished and more
concentrated. Therefore, although journalism
is a good teacher of promptitude and decision,
it often spoils a hand for higher literature
by incapacitating it for perfect finish; and it is
better for a writer who has ambition to write
little, <i>but always his best</i>, than to dilute himself
in daily columns. One of the greatest privileges
which an author can aspire to is <i>to be allowed
to write little</i>, and that is a privilege
which the professional writer does not enjoy
except in such rare instances as that of Tennyson,
whose careful finish is as prudent in
the professional sense as it is satisfactory to
the scrupulous fastidiousness of the artist.</p>

<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>TO AN ENERGETIC AND SUCCESSFUL COTTON MANUFACTURER.</h5>

<p class="pro">Two classes in their lower grades inevitably hostile&mdash;The spiritual
and temporal powers&mdash;The functions of both not
easily exercised by the same person&mdash;Humboldt, Faraday,
Livingstone&mdash;The difficulty about time&mdash;Limits to the energy

of the intellectual class absolutely necessary in a highly
civilized community&mdash;That it grows in numbers and influence
side by side with the industrial class.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Our</span> last conversation together, in the privacy
of your splendid new drawing-room after
the guests had gone away and the music had
ceased for the night, left me under the impression
that we had not arrived at a perfect
understanding of each other. This was due
in a great measure to my unfortunate incapacity
for expressing anything exactly by
spoken words. The constant habit of writing,
which permits a leisurely selection from one&rsquo;s
ideas, is often very unfavorable to readiness
in conversation. Will you permit me, then,
to go over the ground we traversed, this time
in my own way, pen in hand?</p>

<p>We represent, you and I, two classes which
in their lower grades are inevitably hostile;
but the superior members of these classes
ought not to feel any hostility, since both are
equally necessary to the world. We are, in
truth, the spiritual and the temporal powers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>514</span>
in their most modern form. The chief of industry
and the man of letters stand to-day in
the same relation to each other and to mankind
as the baron and bishop of the Middle
Ages. We are not recognized, either of us, by
formally conferred titles, we are both held to
be somewhat intrusive by the representatives
of a former order of things, and there is, or
was until very lately, a certain disposition to
deny what we consider our natural rights;
but we know that our powers are not to be resisted,
and we have the inward assurance that
the forces of nature are with us.</p>

<p>This, with reference to the outer world.
But there is a want of clearness in the relation
between ourselves. You understand
your great temporal function, which is the
wise direction of the industry of masses, the
accumulation and distribution of wealth; but
you do not so clearly understand the spiritual
function of the intellectual class, and you do
not think of it quite justly. This want of understanding
is called by some of us your Philistinism.
Will you permit me to explain what
the intellectual class thinks of you, and what
is its opinion about itself?</p>

<p>Pray excuse any appearance of presumption
on my part if I say we of the intellectual
class and you of the industrial. My position
is something like that of the clergyman who
reads, &ldquo;Let him come to me or to some other
learned and discreet minister of God&rsquo;s word,&rdquo;
thereby calling himself learned and discreet.
It is a simple matter of fact that I belong to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>515</span>
the intellectual class, since I lead its life, just
as it is a fact that you have a quarter of a
million of money.</p>

<p>First, I want to show that the existence of
my class is necessary.</p>

<p>Although men in various occupations often
acquire a considerable degree of culture outside
their trade, the highest results of culture
can scarcely ever be attained by men whose
time is taken up in earning a fortune. Every
man has but a limited flow of mental energy
per day; and if this is used up in an industrial
leadership, he cannot do much more in
the intellectual sphere than simply ascertain
what has been done by others. Now, although
we have a certain respect, and the respect is
just, for those who know what others have
accomplished, it is clear that if no one did
more than this, if no one made any fresh discoveries,
the world would make no progress
whatever; and in fact, if nobody ever had
been dedicated to intellectual pursuits in preceding
ages, the men who only learn what
others have done, would in these days have
had nothing to learn. Past history proves
the immensity of the debt which the world
owes to men who gave their whole time and
attention to intellectual pursuits; and if the
existences of these men could be eliminated
from the past of the human race, its present
would be very different from what it is. A
list has been published of men who have done
much good work in the intervals of business,
but still the fact remains that the great intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>516</span>
pioneers were absorbed and devoted
men, scorning wealth so far as it affected
themselves, and ready to endure everything
for knowledge beyond the knowledge of their
times. Instances of such enthusiasm abound,
an enthusiasm fully justified by the value of
the results which it has achieved. When
Alexander Humboldt sold his inheritance to
have the means for his great journey in South
America, and calmly dedicated the whole of
a long life, and the strength of a robust constitution,
to the advancement of natural
knowledge, he acted foolishly indeed, if years,
and strength, and fortune are given to us only
to be well invested in view of money returns;
but the world has profited by his decision.
Faraday gave up the whole of his time to discovery
when he might have earned a large
fortune by the judicious investment of his
extraordinary skill in chemistry. Livingstone
has sacrificed everything to the pursuit
of his great work in Africa. Lives such as
these&mdash;and many resemble them in useful devotion
of which we hear much less&mdash;are
clearly not compatible with much money-getting.
A decent existence, free from debt, is
all that such men ought to be held answerable
for.</p>

<p>I have taken two or three leading instances,
but there is quite a large class of intellectual
people who cannot in the nature of things
serve society effectively in their own way
without being quite outside of the industrial
life. There is a real incompatibility between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>517</span>
some pursuits and others. I suspect that you
would have been a good general, for you are
a born leader and commander of men; but it
would have been difficult to unite a regular
military career with strict personal attention
to your factories. We often find the same
difficulty in our intellectual pursuits. We
are not always quite so unpractical as you
think we are; but the difficulty is how to find
the time, and how to arrange it so as not to
miss two or three distinct classes of opportunities.
We are not all of us exactly imbeciles
in money matters, though the pecuniary
results of our labors seem no doubt pitiful
enough. There is a tradition that a Greek
philosopher, who was suspected by the practical
men of his day of incapacity for affairs,
devoted a year to prove the contrary, and
traded so judiciously that he amassed
thereby great riches. It may be doubtful
whether he could do it in one year, but many
a fine intellectual capacity has overshadowed
a fine practical capacity in the same head by
the withdrawal of time and effort.</p>

<p>It is because the energies of one man are so
limited, and there is so little time in a single
human life, that the intellectual and industrial
functions must, <i>in their highest development</i>,
be separated. No one man could unite
in his own person your life and Humboldt&rsquo;s,
though it is possible that he might have the
natural capacity for both. Grant us, then,
the liberty <i>not</i> to earn very much money,
and this being once granted, try to look upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>518</span>
our intellectual superiority as a simple natural
fact, just as we look upon your pecuniary
superiority.</p>

<p>In saying in this plain way that we are intellectually
superior to you and your class, I
am guilty of no more pride and vanity than
you when you affirm or display your wealth.
The fact is there, in its simplicity. We have
culture because we have paid the twenty or
thirty years of labor which are the price of
culture, just as you have great factories and
estates which are the reward of your life&rsquo;s
patient and intelligent endeavor.</p>

<p>Why should there be any narrow jealousy
between us; why any contempt on the one
side or the other? Each has done his appointed
work, each has caused to fructify the
talent which the Master gave.</p>

<p>Yet a certain jealousy <i>does</i> exist, if not between
you and me personally, at least between
our classes. The men who have culture
without wealth are jealous of the power
and privileges of those who possess money
without culture; and on the other hand, the
men whose time has been too entirely absorbed
by commercial pursuits to leave them any margin
sufficient to do justice to their intellectual
powers, are often painfully sensitive to the
contempt of the cultivated, and strongly disposed,
from jealousy, to undervalue culture
itself. Both are wrong so far as they indulge
any unworthy and unreasonable feeling of
this kind. The existence of the two classes is
necessary to an advanced civilization. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>519</span>
science of accumulating and administrating
material wealth, of which you yourself are a
great practical master, is the foundation of
the material prosperity of nations, and it is
only when this prosperity is fully assured to
great numbers that the arts and sciences can
develop themselves in perfect liberty and
with the tranquil assurance of their own permanence.
The advancement of material well-being
in modern states tends so directly to
the advancement of intellectual pursuits,
even when the makers of fortunes are themselves
indifferent to this result, that it ought
always to be a matter of congratulation for
the intellectual class itself, which needs the
support of a great public with leisure to read
and think. It is easy to show how those arts
and sciences which our class delights to cultivate
are built upon those developments of industry
which have been brought about by the
energy of yours. Suppose the case of a scientific
chemist: the materials for his experiments
are provided ready to his hand by the
industrial class; the record of them is preserved
on paper manufactured by the same
industrial class; and the public which encourages
him by its attention is usually found
in great cities which are maintained by the
labors of the same useful servants of humanity.
It is possible, no doubt, in these modern
times, that some purely pastoral or agricultural
community might produce a great chemist,
because a man of inborn scientific genius
who came into the world in an agricultural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page520" id="page520"></a>520</span>
country might in these days get his books and
materials from industrial centres at a distance,
but his work would still be based on
the industrial life of others. No pastoral or
agricultural community which was really
isolated from industrial communities ever
produced a chemist. And now consider how
enormously important this one science of
chemistry has proved itself even to our intellectual
life! Several other sciences have
been either greatly strengthened or else altogether
renewed by it, and the wonderful photographic
processes have been for nature and
the fine arts what printing was for literature,
placing reliable and authentic materials for
study within the reach of every one. Literature
itself has profited by the industrial progress
of the present age, in the increased
cheapness of everything that is material in
books. I please myself with the reflection
that even you make paper cheaper by manufacturing
so much cotton.</p>

<p>All these are reasons why we ought not to
be jealous of you; and now permit me to indicate
a few other reasons why it is unreasonable
on your part to feel any jealousy of us.</p>

<p>Suppose we were to cease working to-morrow&mdash;cease
working, I mean, in our peculiar
ways&mdash;and all of us become colliers and factory
operatives instead, with nobody to supply
our places. Or, since you may possibly
be of opinion that there is enough literature
and science in the world at the present day,
suppose rather that at some preceding date
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page521" id="page521"></a>521</span>
the whole literary and scientific and artistic
labor of the human race; had come suddenly
to a standstill. Mind, I do not say of Englishmen
merely, but of the whole race, for if any
intellectual work had been done in France or
Germany, or even in Japan, you would have
imported it like cotton and foreign cereals.
Well, I have no hesitation in telling you that
although there was a good deal of literature
and science in England before the 1st of January,
1800, the present condition of the nation
would have been a very chaotic condition if
the intellectual class had ceased on that day
to think and observe and to place on record
its thoughts and observations. The life of a
progressive nation cannot long go forward exclusively
on the thinking of the past: its
thoughtful men must not be all dead men,
but living men who accompany it on its
course. It is they who make clear the lessons
of experience; it is they who discover
the reliable general laws upon which all safe
action must be founded in the future; it is they
who give decision to human action in every direction
by constantly registering, in language
of comprehensive accuracy, both its successes
and its failures. It is their great and arduous
labor which makes knowledge accessible
to men of action at the cost of little effort and
the smallest possible expenditure of time.
The intellectual class grows in numbers and
in influence along with the numbers and influence
of the materially productive population
of the State. And not only are the natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>522</span>
philosophers, the writers of contemporary
and past history, the discoverers in science,
<i>necessary</i> in the strictest sense to the life of
such a community as the modern English
community, but even the poets, the novelists,
the artists are necessary to the perfection of
its life. Without them and their work the
national mind would be as incomplete as
would be the natural universe without beauty.
But this, perhaps, you will perceive less
clearly, or be less willing to admit.</p>

<h3>LETTER V.</h3>

<h5>TO A YOUNG ETONIAN WHO THOUGHT OF BECOMING
A COTTON-SPINNER.</h5>

<p class="pro">Absurd old prejudices against commerce&mdash;Stigma attached
to the great majority of occupations&mdash;Traditions of feudalism&mdash;Distinctions
between one trade and another&mdash;A
real instance of an Etonian who had gone into the cotton-trade&mdash;Observations
on this case&mdash;The trade a fine field
for energy&mdash;A poor one for intellectual culture&mdash;It develops
practical ability&mdash;Culture not possible without leisure&mdash;The
founders of commercial fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is agreeable to see various indications
that the absurd old prejudices against commerce
are certainly declining. There still remains
quite enough contempt for trade in the
professional classes and the aristocracy, to
give us frequent opportunities for studying it
as a relic of former superstition, unhappily
not yet rare enough to be quite a curiosity;
but as time passes and people become more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>523</span>
rational, it will retreat to out-of-the-way corners
of old country mansions and rural parsonages,
at a safe distance from the light-giving
centres of industry. It is a surprising
fact, and one which proves the almost pathetic
spirit of deference and submission to
superiors which characterizes the English
people, that out of the hundreds of occupations
which are followed by the busy classes
of this country, only three are entirely free
from some degrading stigma, so that they
may be followed by a high-born youth without
any sacrifice of caste. The wonder is
that the great active majority of the nation,
the men who by their industry and intelligence
have made England what she is, should
ever have been willing to submit to so insolent
a rule as this rule of caste, which, instead
of honoring industry, honored idleness, and
attached a stigma to the most useful and important
trades. The landowner, the soldier,
the priest, these three were pure from every
stain of degradation, and only these three
were quite absolutely and ethereally pure.
Next to them came the lawyer and the physician,
on whom there rested some traces of the
lower earth; so that although the youthful
baron would fight or preach, he would neither
plead nor heal. And after these came
the lower professions and the innumerable
trades, all marked with stigmas of deeper
and deeper degradation.</p>

<p>From the intellectual point of view these
prejudices indicate a state of society in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>524</span>
public opinion has not emerged from barbarism.
It understands the strength of the
feudal chief having land, with serfs or voters
on the land; it knows the uses of the sword,
and it dreads the menaces of the priesthood.
Beyond this it knows little, and despises what
it does not understand. It is ignorant of science,
and industry, and art; it despises them
as servile occupations beneath its conception
of the gentleman. This is the tradition of
countries which retain the impressions of
feudalism; but notwithstanding all our philosophy,
it is difficult for us to avoid some feeling
of astonishment when we reflect that the
public opinion of England&mdash;a country that
owes so much of her greatness and nearly all
her wealth to commercial enterprise&mdash;should
be contemptuous towards commerce.</p>

<p>I may notice, in passing, a very curious
form of this narrowness. Trade is despised,
but distinctions are established between one
trade and another. A man who sells wine is
considered more of a gentleman than a man
who sells figs and raisins; and I believe you
will find, if you observe people carefully, that
a woollen manufacturer is thought to be a
shade less vulgar than a cotton manufacturer.
These distinctions are seldom based on reason,
for the work of commerce is generally
very much the same sort of work, mentally,
whatever may be the materials it deals in.
You may be heartily congratulated on the
strength of mind, firmness of resolution, and
superiority to prejudice, which have led you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>525</span>
to choose the business of a cotton-spinner. It
is an excellent business, and, in itself, every
whit as honorable as dealing in corn and cattle,
which our nobles do habitually without
reproach. But now that I have disclaimed
any participation in the stupid narrowness
which despises trade in general, and the cotton-trade
in particular, let me add a few
words upon the effects of the cotton business
on the mind.</p>

<p>There appeared in one of the newspapers a
little time since a most interesting and evidently
genuine letter from an Etonian, who
had actually entered business in a cotton factory,
and devoted himself to it so as to earn
the confidence of his employers and a salary
of 400l. a year as manager. He had waited
some time uselessly for a diplomatic appointment
which did not arrive, and so, rather
than lose the best years of early manhood, as
a more indolent fellow would have done very
willingly, in pure idleness, he took the resolution
of entering business, and carried out his
determination with admirable persistence.
At first nobody would believe that the &ldquo;swell&rdquo;
could be serious; people thought that his idea
of manufacturing was a mere freak, and expected
him to abandon it when he had to face
the tedium of the daily work; but the swell
<i>was</i> serious&mdash;went to the mill at six in the
morning and stayed there till six at night,
from Monday till Saturday inclusive. After
a year of this, his new companions believed
in him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page526" id="page526"></a>526</span> </p>

<p>Now, all this is very admirable indeed as a
manifestation of energy, and that truest independence
which looks to fortune as the reward
of its own manly effort, but it may be
permitted to me to make a few observations
on this young gentleman&rsquo;s resolve. What he
did seems to me rather the act of an energetic
nature seeking an outlet for energy, than of
an intellectual nature seeking pasture and exercise
for the intellect. I am far indeed from
desiring, by this comparison, to cast any disparaging
light on the young gentleman&rsquo;s
natural endowments, which appear to have
been valuable in their order and robust in
their degree, nor do I question the wisdom of
his choice; all I mean to imply is, that
although he had chosen a fine large field for
simple energy, it was a poor and barren field
for the intellect to pasture in. Consider for
one moment the difference in this respect between
the career which he had abandoned
and the trade he had embraced. As an
<i>attaché</i> he would have lived in capital cities,
have had the best opportunities for perfecting
himself in modern languages, and for meeting
the most varied and the most interesting
society. In every day there would have been
precious hours of leisure, to be employed in
the increase of his culture. If an intellectual
man, having to choose between diplomacy
and cotton-spinning, preferred cotton-spinning
it would be from the desire for wealth,
or from the love of an English home. The
life of a cotton manufacturer, who personally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page527" id="page527"></a>527</span>
attends to his business with that close supervision
which has generally conducted to
success, leaves scarcely any margin for intellectual
pleasure or spare energy for intellectual
work. After ten hours in the mill,
it is difficult to sit down and study; and
even if there were energy enough, the mind
would not readily cast off the burden of great
practical anxieties and responsibilities so as
to attune itself to disinterested thinking.
The leaders of industry often display mental
power of as high an order as that which is
employed in the government of great empires;
they show the highest administrative ability,
they have to deal continually with financial
questions which on their smaller scale require
as much forethought and acumen as
those that concern the exchequer; but the
ability they need is always strictly practical,
and there is the widest difference between the
practical and the intellectual minds. A constant
and close pressure of practical considerations
develops the sort of power which
deals effectually with the present and its needs
but atrophies the higher mind. The two
minds which we call intelligence and intellect
resemble the feet and wings of birds. Eagles
and swallows walk badly or not at all, but
they have a marvellous strength of flight;
ostriches are great pedestrians, but they
know nothing of the regions of the air.
The best that can be hoped for men immersed
in the details of business is that they may be
able, like partridges and pheasants, to take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>528</span>
short flight on an emergency, and rise, if
only for a few minutes, above the level of the
stubble and the copse.</p>

<p>Without, therefore, desiring to imply any
prejudiced contempt for trade, I do desire to
urge the consideration of its inevitable effects
upon the mind. For men of great practical
intelligence and abundant energy, trade is all-sufficing,
but it could never entirely satisfy
an intellectual nature. And although there
is drudgery in every pursuit, for even literature
and painting are full of it, still there are
certain kinds of drudgery which intellectual
natures find to be harder to endure than
others. The drudgery which they bear least
easily is an incessant attention to duties
which have no intellectual interest, and yet
which cannot be properly performed mechanically
so as to leave the mind at liberty for its
own speculations. Deep thinkers are notoriously
absent, for thought requires abstraction
from what surrounds us, and it is hard for
them to be denied the liberty of dreaming.
An intellectual person might be happy as a
stone-breaker on the roadside, because the
work would leave his mind at liberty; but he
would certainly be miserable as an engine-driver
at a coal-pit shaft, where the abstraction
of an instant would imperil the lives of
others.</p>

<p>In a recent address delivered by Mr. Gladstone
at Liverpool, he acknowledged the neglect
of culture which is one of the shortcomings
of our trading community, and held out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page529" id="page529"></a>529</span>
the hope (perhaps in some degree illusory)
that the same persons might become eminent
in commerce and in learning. No doubt there
have been instances of this; and when a
&ldquo;concern&rdquo; has been firmly established by the
energy of a predecessor, the heir to it may be
satisfied with a royal sort of supervision,
leaving the drudgery of detail to his managers,
and so secure for himself that sufficient
leisure without which high culture is not possible.
But the <i>founders</i> of great commercial
fortunes have, I believe, in every instance
thrown their <i>whole</i> energy into their trade,
making wealth their aim, and leaving culture
to be added in another generation. The
founders of commercial families are in this
country usually men of great mother-wit and
plenty of determination&mdash;but illiterate.</p>

me, of course, that you had plans for going
somewhere else, but where that might be he
knew not. The civilized English nomad is
usually, like yourself, a person of independent
means, rich enough to bear the expenses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page531" id="page531"></a>531</span>
of frequent removals, but without the cares
of property. His money is safely invested in
the funds, or in railways; and so, wherever
the postman can bring his dividends, he can
live in freedom from material cares. When
his wife is as unsettled as himself, the pair
seem to live in a balloon, or in a sort of
Noah&rsquo;s ark, which goes whither the wind
lists, and takes ground in the most unexpected
places.</p>

<p>Have you ever studied the effect of localities
on the mind&mdash;on your own mind? That
which we are is due in great part to the accident
of our surroundings, which act upon us
in one or two quite opposite ways. Either we
feel in harmony with them, in which case
they produce a positive effect upon us, or else
we are out of harmony, and then they drive
us into the strangest reactions. A great ugly
English town, like Manchester, for instance,
makes some men such thorough townsmen
that they cannot live without smoky chimneys;
or it fills the souls of others with such
a passionate longing for beautiful scenery and
rustic retirement, that they find it absolutely
necessary to bury themselves from time to
time in the recesses of picturesque mountains.
The development of modern landscape-painting
has not been due to habits of rural existence,
but to the growth of very big and hideous
modern cities, which made men long for
shady forests, and pure streams, and magnificent
spectacles of sunset, and dawn, and
moonlight. It is by this time a trite observation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>532</span>
that people who have always lived in
beautiful scenery do not, and cannot, appreciate
it; that too much natural magnificence
positively crushes the activity of the intellect
and that its best effect is simply that of refreshment
for people who have not access to
it every day. It happens too, in a converse
way, that rustics and mountaineers have the
strongest appreciation of the advantages of
great cities, and thrive in them often more
happily than citizens who are born in the
brick streets. Those who have great facilities
for changing their place of residence ought
always to bear in mind that every locality is
like a dyer&rsquo;s vat, and that the residents take
its color, or some other color, from it just as
the clothes do that the dyer steeps in stain.
If you look back upon your past life, you will
assuredly admit that every place has colored
your mental habits; and that although other
tints from other places have supervened, so
that it may be difficult to say precisely what
remains of the place you lived in many years
ago, still something does remain, like the
effect of the first painting on a picture, which
tells on the whole work permanently, though
it may have been covered over and over again
by what painters call scumblings and glazings.</p>

<p>The selection of a place of residence, even
though we only intend to pass a few short
years in it, is from the intellectual point of
view a matter so important that one can
hardly exaggerate its consequences. We see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>533</span>
this quite plainly in the case of authors,
whose minds are more visible to us than the
minds of other men, and therefore more easily
and conveniently studied. We need no biographer
to inform us that Dickens was a Londoner,
that Browning had lived in Italy, that
Ruskin had passed many seasons in Switzerland
and Venice. Suppose for one moment
that these three authors had been born in Ireland,
and had never quitted it, is it not certain
that their production would have been
different? Let us carry our supposition farther
still, and conceive, if we can, the difference
to their literary performance if they had
been born, not in Ireland, but in Iceland, and
lived there all their lives! Is it not highly
probable that in this case their production
would have been so starved and impoverished
from insufficiency of material and of suggestion,
that they would have uttered nothing
but some simple expression of sentiment and
imagination, some homely song or tale? All
sights and sounds have their influence on our
temper and on our thoughts, and our inmost
being is not the same in one place as in another.
We are like blank paper that takes a
tint by reflection from what is nearest, and
changes it as its surroundings change. In a
dull gray room, how gray and dull it looks!
but it will be bathed in rose or amber if the
hangings are crimson or yellow. There are
natures that go to the streams of life in great
cities as the heart goes to the water-brooks;
there are other natures that need the solitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>534</span>
of primæval forests and the silence of the
Alps. The most popular of English novelists
sometimes went to write in the tranquillity of
beautiful scenery, taking his manuscript to
the shore of some azure lake in Switzerland,
in sight of the eternal snow; but all that
beauty and peace, all that sweetness of pure
air and color, were not seductive enough to
overcome for many days the deep longing for
the London streets. His genius needed the
streets, as a bee needs the summer flowers,
and languished when long separated from
them. Others have needed the wild heather,
or the murmur of the ocean, or the sound of
autumn winds that strip great forest-trees.
Who does not deeply pity poor Heine in his
last sad years, when he lay fixed on his couch
of pain in that narrow Parisian lodging, and
compared it to the sounding grave of Merlin
the enchanter, &ldquo;which is situated in the wood
of Brozeliande, in Brittany, under lofty oaks
whose tops taper, like emerald flames, towards
heaven. O brother Merlin,&rdquo; he exclaims,
and with what touching pathos! &ldquo;O
brother Merlin, I envy thee those trees, with
their fresh breezes, for never a green leaf rustles
about this mattress-grave of mine in
Paris, where from morning till night I hear
nothing but the rattle of wheels, the clatter
of hammers, street-brawls, and the jingling
of pianofortes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the biography of Dr. Arnold, his longing
for natural beauty recurs as one of the peculiarities
of his constitution. He did not need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>535</span>
very grand scenery, though he enjoyed it
deeply, but some wild natural loveliness was
such a necessity for him that he pined for it
unhappily in its absence. Rugby could offer
him scarcely anything of this, &ldquo;We have no
hills,&rdquo; he lamented, &ldquo;no plains&mdash;not a single
wood, and but one single copse; no heath, no
down, no rock, no river, no clear stream&mdash;scarcely
any flowers, for the lias is particularly
poor in them&mdash;nothing but one endless
monotony of enclosed fields and hedgerow
trees. This is to me a daily privation; it robs
me of what is naturally my anti-attrition; and
as I grow older I begin to feel it.... The positive
dulness of the country about Rugby
makes it to me a mere working-place: I cannot
expatiate there even in my walks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The monotonous character of the midland
scenery of Warwickshire,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold&rsquo;s
biographer, &ldquo;was to him, with his strong love
of natural beauty and variety, absolutely repulsive;
there was something almost touching
in the eagerness with which, amidst that
&lsquo;endless succession of fields and hedgerows,&rsquo;
he would make the most of any features of a
higher order; in the pleasure with which he
would cherish the few places where the current
of the Avon was perceptible, or where a
glimpse of the horizon could be discerned; in
the humorous despair with which he would
gaze on the dull expanse of fields eastward
from Rugby. It is no wonder we do not like
looking that way, when one considers that
there is nothing fine between us and the Ural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page536" id="page536"></a>536</span>
mountains. Conceive what you look over;
for you just miss Sweden, and look over Holland,
the north of Germany, and the centre
of Russia.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_14" id="FnAnchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

<p>This dreadful midland monotony impelled
Dr. Arnold to seek refreshment and compensation
in a holiday home in the Lake district,
and there he found all that his eyes longed
for, streams, hills, woods, and wild-flowers.
Nor had his belief in the value of these sweet
natural surroundings been illusory; such instincts
are not given for our betrayal, and the
soul of a wise man knows its own needs, both
before they are supplied, and after. Westmorland
gave him all he had hoped from it,
and more. &ldquo;Body and mind,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;alike seem to repose greedily in delicious
quiet, without dulness, which we enjoy in
Westmorland.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;At Allan
Bank, in the summer, I worked on the Roman
history, and hope to do so again in the winter.
It is very inspiring to write with such a view
before one&rsquo;s eyes as that from our drawing-room
at Allan Bank, where the trees of the
shrubbery gradually run up into the trees of
the cliff, and the mountain-side, with its infinite
variety of rocky peaks and points upon
which the cattle expatiate, rises over the tops
of the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of all happily-situated mental laborers
who have worked since the days of Horace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page537" id="page537"></a>537</span>
surely Tycho Brahe was the happiest and
most to be envied. King Frederick of Denmark
gave him a delightful island for his habitation,
large enough for him not to feel imprisoned
(the circumference being about five
miles), yet little enough for him to feel as
snugly at home there as Mr. Waterton in his
high-walled park. The land was fertile and
rich in game, so that the scientific Robinson
Crusoe lived in material abundance; and as
he was only about seven miles from Copenhagen,
he could procure everything necessary
to his convenience. He built a great house on
the elevated land in the midst of the isle,
about three-quarters of a mile from the sea, a
palace of art and science, with statues and
paintings and all the apparatus which the ingenuity
of that age could contrive for the advancement
of astronomical pursuits. Uniting
the case of a rich nobleman&rsquo;s existence with
every aid to science, including special erections
for his instruments, and a printing establishment
that worked under his own immediate
direction, he lived far enough from the
capital to enjoy the most perfect tranquillity,
yet near enough to escape the consequences
of too absolute isolation. Aided in all he undertook
by a staff of assistants that he himself
had trained, supported in his labor by the encouragement
of his sovereign, and especially
by his own unflagging interest in scientific investigation,
he led in that peaceful island the
ideal intellectual life. Of that mansion where
he labored, of the observatory where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>538</span>
watched the celestial phenomena, surrounded
but not disturbed by the waves of a shallow
sea, there remains at this day literally not one
stone upon another; but many a less fortunate
laborer in the same field, harassed by
poverty, distracted by noise and interruption,
has remembered with pardonable envy the
splendid peace of Uranienborg.</p>

<p>It was one of the many fortunate circumstances
in the position of the two Humboldts
that they passed their youth in the quiet old
castle of Tegel, separated from Berlin by a
pine-wood, and surrounded by walks and gardens.
They too, like Tycho Brahe, enjoyed
that happy combination of tranquillity with
the neighborhood of a capital city which is so
peculiarly favorable to culture. In later life,
when Alexander Humboldt had collected those
immense masses of material which were the
result of his travels in South America, he
warmly appreciated the unequalled advantages
of Paris. He knew how to extract from
the solitudes of primæval nature what he
wanted for the enrichment of his mind; but
he knew also how to avail himself of all the
assistance and opportunities which are only
to be had in great capitals. He was not attracted
to town-life, like Dr. Johnson and Mr.
Buckle, to the exclusion of wild nature; but
neither, on the other hand, had he that horror
of towns which was a morbid defect in
Cowper, and which condemns those who
suffer from it to rusticity. Even Galileo, who
thought the country especially favorable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id="page539"></a>539</span>
speculative intellects, and the walls of cities
an imprisonment for them, declared that the
best years of his life were those he had spent
in Padua.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<h5>TO A FRIEND WHO MAINTAINED THAT SURROUNDINGS
WERE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
TO A THOROUGHLY OCCUPIED MIND.</h5>

<p class="pro">Archimedes at the siege of Syracuse&mdash;Geoffroy St. Hilaire in
the besieged city of Alexandria&mdash;Goethe at the bombardment
of Verdun&mdash;Lullo, the Oriental missionary&mdash;Giordano
Bruno&mdash;Unacknowledged effect of surroundings&mdash;Effect
of Frankfort on Goethe&mdash;Great capitals&mdash;Goethe&mdash;His
garden-house&mdash;What he said about Béranger and
Paris&mdash;Fortunate surroundings of Titian.</p>

<p><span class="sc">There</span> are so many well-known instances of
men who have been able to continue their intellectual
labors under the most unfavorable
conditions, that your argument might be powerfully
supported by an appeal to actual experience.
There is Archimedes, of course, to
begin with, who certainly seems to have abstracted
himself sufficiently from the tumult
of a great siege to forget it altogether when
occupied with his mathematical problems.
The prevalent stories of his death, though not
identical, point evidently to a habit of abstraction
which had been remarked as a peculiarity
by those about him, and it is probable
enough that a great inventor in engineering
would follow his usual speculations under circumstances
which, though dangerous, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>540</span>
lasted long enough to become habitual. Even
modern warfare, which from the use of gunpowder
is so much noisier than that which
raged at Syracuse, does not hinder men from
thinking and writing when they are used to
it. Geoffrey St. Hilaire never worked more
steadily and regularly in his whole life than
he did in the midst of the besieged city of
Alexandria. &ldquo;Knowledge is so sweet,&rdquo; he
said long afterwards, in speaking of this experience,
&ldquo;that it never entered my thoughts
how a bombshell might in an instant have
cast into the abyss both me and my documents.&rdquo;
By good luck two electric fish had
been caught and given to him just then, so he
immediately began to make experiments, as
if he had been in his own cabinet in Paris,
and for three weeks he thought of nothing
else, utterly forgetting the fierce warfare that
filled the air with thunder and flame, and the
streets with victims. He had sixty-four hypotheses
to amuse him, and it was necessary
to review his whole scientific acquirement
with reference to each of these as he considered
them one by one. It may be doubted,
however, whether he was more in danger
from the bombardment or from the intensity
of his own mental concentration. He grew
thin and haggard, slept one hour in the twenty-four,
and lived in a perilous condition of
nervous strain and excitement. Goethe at
the bombardment of Verdun, letting his mind
take its own course, found that it did not occupy
itself with tragedies, or with anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>541</span>
suggested by what was passing in the conflict
around him, but by scientific considerations
about the phenomena of colors. He noticed,
in a passing observation, the bad effect of war
upon the mind, how it makes people destructive
one day and creative the next, how it accustoms
them to phases intended to excite
hope in desperate circumstances, thus producing
a peculiar sort of hypocrisy different
from the priestly and courtly kind. This is
the extent of his interest in the war; but
when he finds some soldiers fishing he is attracted
to the spot and profoundly occupied&mdash;not
with the soldiers, but with the optical
phenomena on the water. He was never very
much moved by external events, nor did he
take that intense interest in the politics of the
day which we often find in people less studious
of literature and science. Raimond Lullo,
the Oriental missionary, continued to write
many volumes in the midst of the most continual
difficulties and dangers, preserving as
much mental energy and clearness as if he
had been safe and tranquil in a library. Giordano
Bruno worked constantly also in the
midst of political troubles and religious persecutions,
and his biographer tells us that &ldquo;il
desiderio vivissimo della scienza aveva ben
più efficacia sull&rsquo; animo del Bruno, che non
gli avvenimenti esterni.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These examples which have just occurred
to me, and many others that it would be easy
to collect, may be taken to prove at least so
much as this, that it is possible to be absorbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>542</span>
in private studies when surrounded by the
most disturbing influences; but even in these
cases it would be a mistake to conclude that
the surroundings had no effect whatever.
There can be no doubt that Geoffroy St. Hilaire
was intensely excited by the siege of Alexandria,
though he may not have attributed
his excitement to that cause. His mind was
occupied with the electrical fishes, but his
nervous system was wrought upon by the
siege, and kept in that state of tension which
at the same time enabled him to get through
a gigantic piece of intellectual labor and made
him incapable of rest. Had this condition
been prolonged it must have terminated
either in exhaustion or in madness. Men have
often engaged in literature or science to escape
the pressure of anxiety, which strenuous
mental labor permits us, at least temporarily,
to forget; but the circumstances which
surround us have invariably an influence of
some kind upon our thinking, though the
connection may not be obvious. Even in the
case of Goethe, who could study optics on
a battle-field, his English biographer recognizes
the effect of the Frankfort life which
surrounded the great author in his childhood.
&ldquo;The old Frankfort city, with its busy
crowds, its fairs, its mixed population, and its
many sources of excitement, offered great
temptations and great pasture to so desultory
a genius. This is perhaps a case wherein circumstances
may be seen influencing the direction
of character.... A large continuity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id="page543"></a>543</span>
of thought and effort was perhaps radically
uncongenial to such a temperament; yet one
cannot help speculating whether under other
circumstances he might not have achieved it.
Had he been reared in a quiet little old German
town, where he would have daily seen
the same faces in the silent streets, and come
in contact with the same characters, his culture
might have been less various, but it
might perhaps have been deeper. Had he
been reared in the country, with only the
changing seasons and the sweet serenities of
nature to occupy his attention when released
from study, he would certainly have been a
different poet. The long summer afternoons
spent in lonely rambles, the deepening twilights
filled with shadowy visions, the slow
uniformity of his external life necessarily
throwing him more and more upon the
subtler diversities of inward experience,
would inevitably have influenced his genius
in quite different directions, would have animated
his works with a very different spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are sometimes told that life in a great
capital is essential to the development of genius,
but Frankfort was the largest town
Goethe ever lived in, and he never visited
either Paris or London. Much of the sanity
of his genius may have been due to his residence
in so tranquil a place as Weimar, where
he could shut himself up in his &ldquo;garden-house&rdquo;
and lock all the gates of the bridge
over the Ilm. &ldquo;The solitude,&rdquo; says Mr.
Lewes, &ldquo;is absolute, broken only by the occasional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page544" id="page544"></a>544</span>
sound of the church clock, the music
from the barracks, and the screaming of the
peacocks spreading their superb beauty in
the park.&rdquo; Few men of genius have been
happier in their surroundings than Goethe.
He had tranquillity, and yet was not deprived
of intellectual intercourse; the scenery within
excursion-distance from his home was interesting
and even inspiring, yet not so
splendid as to be overwhelming. We know
from his conversations that he was quite
aware of the value of those little centres of
culture to Germany, and yet in one place he
speaks of Béranger in the tone which seems
to imply an appreciation of the larger life of
Paris. &ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;this same Béranger
away from Paris, and the influence and
opportunities of a world-city, born as the
son of a poor tailor, at Jena or Weimar; let
him run his wretched career in either of the
two small cities, and see what fruit would
have grown on such a soil and in such an atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We cannot too frequently be reminded
that we are nothing of ourselves, and by ourselves,
and are only something by the place
we hold in the intellectual chain of humanity
by which electricity is conveyed to us and
through us&mdash;to be increased in the transmission
if we have great natural power and are
favorably situated, but not otherwise. A
child is born to the Vecelli family at Cadore,
and when it is nine years old is taken to Venice
and placed under the tuition of Sebastian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page545" id="page545"></a>545</span>
Zuccato. Afterwards he goes to Bellini&rsquo;s
school, and there gets acquainted with another
student, one year his junior, whose
name is Barbarelli. They live together and
work together in Venice; then young Barbarelli
(known to posterity as Giorgione),
after putting on certain spaces of wall and
squares of canvas such color as the world had
never before seen, dies in his early manhood
and leaves Vecellio, whom we call Titian, to
work on there in Venice till the plague stays
his hand in his hundredth year. The genius
came into the world, but all the possibilities
of his development depended upon the place
and the time. He came exactly in the right
place and precisely at the right time. To be
born not far from Venice in the days of Bellini,
to be taken there at nine years old, to
have Giorgione for one&rsquo;s comrade, all this
was as fortunate for an artistic career as the
circumstances of Alexander of Macedon were
for a career of conquest.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>TO AN ARTIST WHO WAS FITTING UP A MAGNIFICENT
NEW STUDIO.</h5>

<p class="pro">Pleasure of planning a studio&mdash;Opinions of an outsider&mdash;Saint
Bernard&mdash;Father Ravignan&mdash;Goethe&rsquo;s study and bed-room&mdash;Gustave
Doré&rsquo;s studio&mdash;Leslie&rsquo;s painting-room&mdash;Turner&rsquo;s
opinion&mdash;Habits of Scott and Dickens&mdash;Extremes good&mdash;Vulgar
mediocrity not so good&mdash;Value of beautiful views
to literary men&mdash;Montaigne&mdash;Views from the author&rsquo;s
windows.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Nothing</span> in the life of an artist is more
agreeable than the building and furnishing of
the studio in which he hopes to produce his
most mature and perfect work. It is so pleasant
to labor when we are surrounded by
beauty and convenience, that painters find a
large and handsome studio to be an addition
to the happiness of their lives, and they usually
dream of it, and plan it, several years before
the dream is realized.</p>

<p>Only a few days ago I was talking on this
very subject with an intellectual friend who
is not an artist, and who maintained that the
love of fine studios is in great part a mere illusion.
He admitted the necessity for size, and
for a proper kind of light, but laughed at
carved oak, and tapestry, and armor, and the
knicknacks that artists encumber themselves
with. He would have it that a mind thoroughly
occupied with its own business knew nothing
whatever of the objects that surrounded
it, and he cited two examples&mdash;Saint Bernard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page547" id="page547"></a>547</span>
who travelled all day by the shore of Lake
Leman without seeing it, and the <i>père</i> Ravignan,
who worked in a bare little room with a
common table of blackened pine and a cheap
rush-bottomed chair. On this I translated to
him, from Goethe&rsquo;s life by Lewes, a passage
which was new to him and delighted him as a
confirmation of his theory. The biographer
describes the poet&rsquo;s study as &ldquo;a low-roofed
narrow room, somewhat dark, for it is lighted
only through two tiny windows, and furnished
with a simplicity quite touching to behold.
In the centre stands a plain oval table
of unpolished oak. No arm-chair is to be seen,
no sofa, nothing which speaks of ease. A
plain hard chair has beside it the basket in
which he used to place his handkerchief.
Against the wall, on the right, is a long pear-tree
table, with bookshelves, on which stand
lexicons and manuals.... On the side-wall
again, a bookcase with some works of poets.
On the wall to the left is a long desk of soft
wood, at which he was wont to write. A
sheet of paper with notes of contemporary history
is fastened near the door. The same
door leads into a bed-room, if bed-room it can
be called, which no maid-of-all-work in England
would accept without a murmur: it is a
closet with a window. A simple bed, an armchair
by its side, and a tiny washing-table
with a small white basin on it, and a sponge,
is all the furniture. To enter this room with
any feeling for the greatness and goodness of
him who slept here, and who here slept his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id="page548"></a>548</span>
last sleep, brings tears into our eyes, and
makes the breathing deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I had finished reading this passage,
my friend exclaimed triumphantly, &ldquo;There!
don&rsquo;t you see that it was just because Goethe
had imaginative power of a strong and active
kind that he cared nothing about what surrounded
him when he worked? He had statues
and pictures to occupy his mind when it
was disengaged, but when he wrote he preferred
that bare little cell where nothing was
to be seen that could distract his attention for
an instant. Depend upon it, Goethe acted in
this matter either from a deliberate and most
wise calculation, or else from the sure instinct
of genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whilst we were on this subject I thought
over other instances, and remembered my
surprise on visiting Gustave Doré in his
painting-room in Paris. Doré has a Gothic
exuberance of imagination, so I expected a
painting-room something like Victor Hugo&rsquo;s
house, rather barbarous, but very rich and
interesting, with plenty of carved cabinets,
and tapestry, and <i>biblos</i>, as they call picturesque
curiosities in Paris. To my surprise,
there was nothing (except canvases and
easels) but a small deal table, on which tubes
of oil-color were thrown in disorder, and two
cheap chairs. Here, evidently, the pleasure
of painting was sufficient to occupy the artist;
and in the room where he made his illustrations
the characteristics were simplicity and
good practical arrangements for order, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page549" id="page549"></a>549</span>
there was nothing to amuse the imagination.
Mr. Leslie used to paint in a room which
was just like any other in the house, and
had none of the peculiarities of a studio.
Turner did not care in the least what sort of a
room he painted in, provided it had a door,
and a bolt on the inside. Scott could write
anywhere, even in the family sitting-room,
with talk going forward as usual; and after
he had finished Abbotsford, he did not write
in any of its rich and noble rooms, but in a
simple closet with book-shelves round it.
Dickens wrote in a comfortable room, well
lighted and cheerful, and he liked to have
funny little bronzes on his writing-table.</p>

<p>The best way appears to be to surround
ourselves, whenever it can be conveniently
done, with whatever we know by experience
to be favorable to our work. I think the
barest cell monk ever prayed in would be a
good place for imaginative composition, and
so too would be the most magnificent rooms
in Chatsworth or Blenheim. A middling sort
of place with a Philistine character, vulgar
upholstery, and vulgar pictures or engravings,
is really dangerous, because these things
often attract attention in the intervals of
labor and occupy it in a mean way. An artist
is always the better for having something
that may profitably amuse and occupy his
eye when he quits his picture, and I think it
is a right instinct which leads artists to surround
themselves with many picturesque and
beautiful things, not too orderly in their arrangement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page550" id="page550"></a>550</span>
so that there may be pleasant
surprises for the eye, as there are in nature.</p>

<p>For literary men there is nothing so valuable
as a window with a cheerful and beautiful
prospect. It is good for us to have this refreshment
for the eye when we leave off working,
and Montaigne did wisely to have his
study up in a tower from which he had extensive
views.</p>

<p>There is a well-known objection to extensive
views, as wanting in snugness and comfort,
but this objection scarcely applies to the especial
case of literary men. What we want
is not so much snugness as relief, refreshment,
suggestion, and we get these, as a general
rule, much better from wide prospects
than from limited ones. I have just alluded
to Montaigne,&mdash;will you permit me to imitate
that dear old philosopher in his egotism and
describe to you the view from the room I
write in, which cheers and amuses me continually?
But before describing this let me
describe another of which the recollection is
very dear to me and as vivid as a freshly-painted
picture. In years gone by, I had
only to look up from my desk and see a noble
loch in its inexhaustible loveliness, and a
mountain in its majesty. It was a daily and
hourly delight to watch the breezes play
about the enchanted isles, on the delicate silvery
surface, dimming some clear reflection,
or trailing it out in length, or cutting sharply
across it with acres of rippling blue. It was
a frequent pleasure to see the clouds play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page551" id="page551"></a>551</span>
about the crest of Cruachan and Ben Vorich&rsquo;s
golden head, gray mists that crept upwards
from the valleys till the sunshine suddenly
caught them and made them brighter than
the snows they shaded. And the leagues and
leagues of heather on the lower land to the
southward that became like the aniline dyes
of deepest purple and blue, when the sky was
gray in the evening&mdash;all save one orange-streak!
Ah, those were spectacles never to
be forgotten, splendors of light and glory, and
sadness of deepening gloom when the eyes
grew moist in the twilight and secretly drank
their tears.</p>

<p>And yet, wonderful as it was, that noble
and passionately beloved Highland scenery
was wanting in one great element that a
writer imperatively needs. In all that natural
magnificence humanity held no place.
Hidden behind a fir-clad promontory to the
north, there still remained, it is true, the gray
ruin of old Kilchurn, and far to the south-west,
in another reach of the lake, the island-fortress
of Ardhonnel. But there was not a
visible city with spires and towers, there
were only the fir-trees on the little islands
and a few gravestones on the largest. Beyond,
were the depopulated deserts of Breadalbane.</p>

<p>Here, where I write to you now, it seems as
if mankind were nearer, and the legends of
the ages written out for me on the surface of
the world. Under the shadow of Jove&rsquo;s hill
rises before me one of the most ancient of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page552" id="page552"></a>552</span>
European cities, <i>soror et æmula Romæ</i>. She
bears on her walls and edifices the record of
sixty generations. Temple, and arch, and
pyramid, all these bear witness still, and so
do her ancient bulwarks, and many a stately
tower. High above all, the cathedral spire is
drawn dark in the morning mist, and often
in the clear summer evenings it comes
brightly in slanting sunshine against the
steep woods behind. Then the old city arrays
herself in the warmest and mellowest
tones, and glows as the shadows fall. She
reigns over the whole width of her valley to
the folds of the far blue hills. Even so ought
our life to be surrounded by the loveliness of
nature&mdash;surrounded, but not subdued.</p>
